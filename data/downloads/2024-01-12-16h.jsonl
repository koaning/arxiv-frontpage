Based on a user-provided textual description and a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint, InseRF generates new objects in 3D scenes. Recently, methods for 3D scene editing have been profoundly transformed, owing to the use of strong priors of text-to-image diffusion models in 3D generative modeling. Existing methods are mostly effective in editing 3D scenes via style and appearance changes or removing existing objects. Generating new objects, however, remains a challenge for such methods, which we address in this study. Specifically, we propose grounding the 3D object insertion to a 2D object insertion in a reference view of the scene. The 2D edit is then lifted to 3D using a single-view object reconstruction method. The reconstructed object is then inserted into the scene, guided by the priors of monocular depth estimation methods. We evaluate our method on various 3D scenes and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed components. Our experiments with generative insertion of objects in several 3D scenes indicate the effectiveness of our method compared to the existing methods. InseRF is capable of controllable and 3D-consistent object insertion without requiring explicit 3D information as input.

Numerous previous works train their models using the well-established connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. During the inference stage, the CTC-based models typically take the entire sign video as input to make predictions. This type of inference scheme is referred to as offline recognition. In contrast, while mature speech recognition systems can efficiently recognize spoken words on the fly, sign language recognition still falls short due to the lack of practical online solutions. In this work, we take the first step towards filling this gap. Our approach comprises three phases: 1) developing a sign language dictionary encompassing all glosses present in a target sign language dataset; 2) training an isolated sign language recognition model on augmented signs using both conventional classification loss and our novel saliency loss; 3) employing a sliding window approach on the input sign sequence and feeding each sign clip to the well-optimized model for online recognition. Furthermore, our online recognition model can be extended to boost the performance of any offline model, and to support online translation by appending a gloss-to-text network onto the recognition model. By integrating our online framework with the previously best-performing offline model, TwoStream-SLR, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily.

To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities. Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations. To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities. The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations. To this end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature. By removing non-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport. This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities. In addition, we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability. We also demonstrate quick personalization of URHand from a short phone scan of an unseen identity.","sentences":["Existing photorealistic relightable hand models require extensive identity-specific observations in different views, poses, and illuminations, and face challenges in generalizing to natural illuminations and novel identities.","To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities.","Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations.","To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities.","The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations.","To this end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature.","By removing non-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport.","This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities.","In addition, we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization.","Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability.","We also demonstrate quick personalization of URHand from a short phone scan of an unseen identity."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05334v1"}

The results for the final AT prediction are promising, showing low errors even when predicting several stops ahead. Yet, no single model emerges as universally superior, and we provide insights into the characteristics of pilot sites that influence the model selection process. Finally, we identify dwell time prediction as the key determinant in overall AT prediction accuracy when autonomous shuttles are deployed in low-traffic areas or under regulatory speed limits.

To address this problem, we introduced the SoftFoot, an adaptive foot design that can enhance walking performance over irregular grounds. The proposed design is completely passive and varies its shape and stiffness based on the exerted forces, through a system of pulley, tendons, and springs opportunely placed in the structure. This paper outlines the motivation behind the SoftFoot and describes the theoretical model which led to its final design. The proposed system has been experimentally tested and compared with two analogous conventional feet, a rigid one and a compliant one, with similar footprints and soles. The experimental validation focuses on the analysis of the standing performance, measured in terms of the equivalent support surface extension and the compensatory ankle angle, and the rejection of impulsive forces, which is important in events such as stepping on unforeseen obstacles. Results show that the SoftFoot has the largest equivalent support surface when standing on obstacles, and absorbs impulsive loads in a way almost as good as a compliant foot.","sentences":["Robot feet are crucial for maintaining dynamic stability and propelling the body during walking, especially on uneven terrains.","Traditionally, robot feet were mostly designed as flat and stiff pieces of metal, which meets its limitations when the robot is required to step on irregular grounds, e.g. stones.","While one could think that adding compliance under such feet would solve the problem, this is not the case.","To address this problem, we introduced the SoftFoot, an adaptive foot design that can enhance walking performance over irregular grounds.","The proposed design is completely passive and varies its shape and stiffness based on the exerted forces, through a system of pulley, tendons, and springs opportunely placed in the structure.","This paper outlines the motivation behind the SoftFoot and describes the theoretical model which led to its final design.","The proposed system has been experimentally tested and compared with two analogous conventional feet, a rigid one and a compliant one, with similar footprints and soles.","The experimental validation focuses on the analysis of the standing performance, measured in terms of the equivalent support surface extension and the compensatory ankle angle, and the rejection of impulsive forces, which is important in events such as stepping on unforeseen obstacles.","Results show that the SoftFoot has the largest equivalent support surface when standing on obstacles, and absorbs impulsive loads in a way almost as good as a compliant foot."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05318v1"}

In this work, we show that misalignment in the platform's objective is not the only potential cause of unintended impacts on users: even when the platform's objective is fully aligned with user welfare, the platform's learning algorithm can induce negative downstream impacts on users. The source of these user impacts is that different pieces of content may generate observable user reactions (feedback information) at different rates; these feedback rates may correlate with content properties, such as controversiality or demographic similarity of the creator, that affect the user experience. Since differences in feedback rates can impact how often the learning algorithm engages with different content, the learning algorithm may inadvertently promote content with certain such properties. Using the multi-armed bandit framework with probabilistic feedback, we examine the relationship between feedback rates and a learning algorithm's engagement with individual arms for different no-regret algorithms.

In particular, attenuation and volume measures of muscle and fat are associated with important clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular events, fractures, and death. This study evaluates the reliability of an Internal tool for the segmentation of muscle and fat (subcutaneous and visceral) as compared to the well-established public TotalSegmentator tool.   Methods: We assessed the tools across 900 CT series from the publicly available SAROS dataset, focusing on muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. The Dice score was employed to assess accuracy in subcutaneous fat and muscle segmentation. Due to the lack of ground truth segmentations for visceral fat, Cohen's Kappa was utilized to assess segmentation agreement between the tools.

However, deriving controller parameters for complex and nonlinear systems is challenging and time-consuming. To facilitate automatic controller parametrization, this work presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with N-dimensional B-spline geometries (BSGs). We focus on the control of parameter-variant systems, a class of systems with complex behavior which depends on the operating conditions. For this system class, gain-scheduling control structures are widely used in applications across industries due to well-known design principles. Facilitating the expensive controller parametrization task regarding these control structures, we deploy an DRL agent. Based on control system observations, the agent autonomously decides how to adapt the controller parameters. We make the adaptation process more efficient by introducing BSGs to map the controller parameters which may depend on numerous operating conditions. To preprocess time-series data and extract a fixed-length feature vector, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Furthermore, this work contributes actor regularizations that are relevant to real-world environments which differ from training. Accordingly, we apply dropout layer normalization to the actor and critic networks of the truncated quantile critic (TQC) algorithm.

However, current works all process data uniformly without considering the problem-solving difficulty, which means an excessive focus on simple questions while insufficient to intricate ones. To address this challenge, we inspired by humans using heuristic strategies to categorize tasks and handle them individually, propose to apply the Divide and Conquer to LLMs reasoning. First, we divide questions into different subsets based on the statistical confidence score ($\\mathcal{CS}$), then fix nearly resolved sets and conquer demanding nuanced process ones with elaborately designed methods, including Prior Knowledge based Reasoning (PKR) and Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR), as well as their integration variants.

Determining an appropriate transmission strategy that satisfies ultra-reliability constraint necessitates derivation of statistics of channel in ultra-reliable region and, subsequently, integration of these statistics into rate selection while incorporating a confidence interval to account for potential uncertainties that may arise during estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ultra-reliable real-time transmission considering both spatial diversities and ultra-reliable channel statistics based on multivariate extreme value theory. First, tail distribution of joint received power sequences obtained from different receivers is modeled while incorporating inter-relations of extreme events occurring rarely based on Poisson point process approach in MEVT. The optimum transmission strategies are then developed by determining optimum transmission rate based on estimated joint tail distribution and incorporating confidence intervals into estimations to cope with the availability of limited data. Finally, system reliability is assessed by utilizing outage probability metric. Through analysis of data obtained from the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, our study showcases the effectiveness of proposed methodology in surpassing traditional extrapolation-based approaches. This innovative method not only achieves a higher transmission rate, but also effectively addresses stringent requirements of ultra-reliability. The findings indicate that proposed rate selection framework offers a viable solution for achieving a desired target error probability by employing a higher transmission rate and reducing the amount of training data compared to conventional rate selection methods.","sentences":["Diversity schemes play a vital role in improving the performance of ultra-reliable communication systems by transmitting over two or more communication channels to combat fading and co-channel interference.","Determining an appropriate transmission strategy that satisfies ultra-reliability constraint necessitates derivation of statistics of channel in ultra-reliable region and, subsequently, integration of these statistics into rate selection while incorporating a confidence interval to account for potential uncertainties that may arise during estimation.","In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ultra-reliable real-time transmission considering both spatial diversities and ultra-reliable channel statistics based on multivariate extreme value theory.","First, tail distribution of joint received power sequences obtained from different receivers is modeled while incorporating inter-relations of extreme events occurring rarely based on Poisson point process approach in MEVT.","The optimum transmission strategies are then developed by determining optimum transmission rate based on estimated joint tail distribution and incorporating confidence intervals into estimations to cope with the availability of limited data.","Finally, system reliability is assessed by utilizing outage probability metric.","Through analysis of data obtained from the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, our study showcases the effectiveness of proposed methodology in surpassing traditional extrapolation-based approaches.","This innovative method not only achieves a higher transmission rate, but also effectively addresses stringent requirements of ultra-reliability.","The findings indicate that proposed rate selection framework offers a viable solution for achieving a desired target error probability by employing a higher transmission rate and reducing the amount of training data compared to conventional rate selection methods."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05171v2"}

Second, POM integrates the polyhedral model into MLIR, enabling advanced dependence analysis and various FPGA-oriented loop transformations. By representing nested loops with integer sets and maps, loop transformations can be conducted conveniently through manipulations on polyhedral semantics. Finally, to further relieve design effort, POM has a user-friendly programming interface (DSL) that allows a concise description of computation and includes a rich collection of scheduling primitives.

To overcome these limitations, we present Multi S-Graphs, a decentralized CSLAM system that utilizes high-level semantic-relational information embedded in the four-layered hierarchical and optimizable situational graphs for cooperative map generation and localization while minimizing the information exchanged between the robots. To support this, we present a novel room-based descriptor which, along with its connected walls, is used to perform inter-robot loop closures, addressing the challenges of multi-robot kidnapped problem initialization. Multiple experiments in simulated and real environments validate the improvement in accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach while reducing the amount of data exchanged between robots compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

The related interdisciplinary research field search as learning aims to understand how people learn on the web. Previous work has investigated several feature classes to predict, for instance, the expected knowledge gain during web search. Therein, eye-tracking features have not been extensively studied so far. In this paper, we extend a previously used reading model from a line-based one to one that can detect reading sequences across multiple lines. We use publicly available study data from a web-based learning task to examine the relationship between our feature set and the participants' test scores. Our findings demonstrate that learners with higher knowledge gain spent significantly more time reading, and processing more words in total. We also find evidence that faster reading at the expense of more backward regressions may be an indicator of better web-based learning.

Instead of centralizing raw data, FL exchanges locally refined model parameters to build a global model incrementally. While FL is more compliant with emerging regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring the right to be forgotten in this context - allowing FL participants to remove their data contributions from the learned model - remains unclear. In addition, it is recognized that malicious clients may inject backdoors into the global model through updates, e.g. to generate mispredictions on specially crafted data examples. Consequently, there is the need for mechanisms that can guarantee individuals the possibility to remove their data and erase malicious contributions even after aggregation, without compromising the already acquired \"good\" knowledge. This highlights the necessity for novel Federated Unlearning (FU) algorithms, which can efficiently remove specific clients' contributions without full model retraining. This survey provides background concepts, empirical evidence, and practical guidelines to design/implement efficient FU schemes. Our study includes a detailed analysis of the metrics for evaluating unlearning in FL and presents an in-depth literature review categorizing state-of-the-art FU contributions under a novel taxonomy.

This study, a pioneering effort to predict the translational potential of dementia research using machine learning, hopes to address the slow translation of fundamental discoveries into practical applications despite dementia's significant societal and economic impact. We used the Dimensions database to extract data from 43,091 UK dementia research publications between the years 1990-2023, specifically metadata (authors, publication year etc.), concepts mentioned in the paper, and the paper abstract. To prepare the data for machine learning we applied methods such as one hot encoding and/or word embeddings. We trained a CatBoost Classifier to predict if a publication will be cited in a future patent or clinical trial. We trained several model variations. The model combining metadata, concept, and abstract embeddings yielded the highest performance: for patent predictions, an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.84 and 77.17% accuracy; for clinical trial predictions, an AUROC of 0.81 and 75.11% accuracy. The results demonstrate that integrating machine learning within current research methodologies can uncover overlooked publications, expediting the identification of promising research and potentially transforming dementia research by predicting real-world impact and guiding translational strategies.","sentences":["Projected to impact 1.6 million people in the UK by 2040 and costing {\\pounds}25 billion annually, dementia presents a growing challenge to society.","This study, a pioneering effort to predict the translational potential of dementia research using machine learning, hopes to address the slow translation of fundamental discoveries into practical applications despite dementia's significant societal and economic impact.","We used the Dimensions database to extract data from 43,091 UK dementia research publications between the years 1990-2023, specifically metadata (authors, publication year etc.), concepts mentioned in the paper, and the paper abstract.","To prepare the data for machine learning we applied methods such as one hot encoding and/or word embeddings.","We trained a CatBoost Classifier to predict if a publication will be cited in a future patent or clinical trial.","We trained several model variations.","The model combining metadata, concept, and abstract embeddings yielded the highest performance: for patent predictions, an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.84 and 77.17% accuracy; for clinical trial predictions, an AUROC of 0.81 and 75.11% accuracy.","The results demonstrate that integrating machine learning within current research methodologies can uncover overlooked publications, expediting the identification of promising research and potentially transforming dementia research by predicting real-world impact and guiding translational strategies."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05145v1"}

Sensitivity classification has received a lot of attention in the literature. However, more recently, there has been increasing interest in developing sensitivity-aware search engines that can provide users with relevant search results, while ensuring that no sensitive documents are returned to the user. Sensitivity-aware search would mitigate the need for a manual sensitivity review prior to collections being made available publicly. To develop such systems, there is a need for test collections that contain relevance assessments for a set of information needs as well as ground-truth labels for a variety of sensitivity categories. The well-known Enron email collection contains a classification ground-truth that can be used to represent sensitive information, e.g., the Purely Personal and Personal but in Professional Context categories can be used to represent sensitive personal information. However, the existing Enron collection does not contain a set of information needs and relevance assessments. In this work, we present a collection of fifty information needs (topics) with crowdsourced query formulations (3 per topic) and relevance assessments (11,471 in total) for the Enron collection (mean number of relevant documents per topic = 11, variance = 34.7). The developed information needs, queries and relevance judgements are available on GitHub and will be available along with the existing Enron collection through the popular ir_datasets library. Our proposed collection results in the first freely available test collection for developing sensitivity-aware search systems.","sentences":["Large archival collections, such as email or government documents, must be manually reviewed to identify any sensitive information before the collection can be released publicly.","Sensitivity classification has received a lot of attention in the literature.","However, more recently, there has been increasing interest in developing sensitivity-aware search engines that can provide users with relevant search results, while ensuring that no sensitive documents are returned to the user.","Sensitivity-aware search would mitigate the need for a manual sensitivity review prior to collections being made available publicly.","To develop such systems, there is a need for test collections that contain relevance assessments for a set of information needs as well as ground-truth labels for a variety of sensitivity categories.","The well-known Enron email collection contains a classification ground-truth that can be used to represent sensitive information, e.g., the Purely Personal and Personal but in Professional Context categories can be used to represent sensitive personal information.","However, the existing Enron collection does not contain a set of information needs and relevance assessments.","In this work, we present a collection of fifty information needs (topics) with crowdsourced query formulations (3 per topic) and relevance assessments (11,471 in total) for the Enron collection (mean number of relevant documents per topic = 11, variance = 34.7).","The developed information needs, queries and relevance judgements are available on GitHub and will be available along with the existing Enron collection through the popular ir_datasets library.","Our proposed collection results in the first freely available test collection for developing sensitivity-aware search systems."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05144v1"}

The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques imitating developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code. The performance of these techniques is usually assessed through quantitative metrics, e.g., the percentage of instances in the test set for which correct predictions are generated, leaving many open questions on the techniques' capabilities. For example, knowing that an approach is able to correctly address a reviewer's comment in 10% of cases is of little value without knowing what was asked by the reviewer: What if in all successful cases the code change required to address the comment was just the removal of an empty line? In this paper we aim at characterizing the cases in which three code review automation techniques tend to succeed or fail in the two above-described tasks. The study has a strong qualitative focus, with ~105 man-hours of manual inspection invested in manually analyzing correct and wrong predictions generated by the three techniques, for a total of 2,291 inspected predictions. The output of this analysis are two taxonomies reporting, for each of the two tasks, the types of code changes on which the experimented techniques tend to succeed or to fail, pointing to areas for future work. A result of our manual analysis was also the identification of several issues in the datasets used to train and test the experimented techniques. Finally, we assess the importance of researching in techniques specialized for code review automation by comparing their performance with ChatGPT, a general purpose large language model, finding that ChatGPT struggles in commenting code as a human reviewer would do.","sentences":["The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost.","The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques imitating developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code.","The performance of these techniques is usually assessed through quantitative metrics, e.g., the percentage of instances in the test set for which correct predictions are generated, leaving many open questions on the techniques' capabilities.","For example, knowing that an approach is able to correctly address a reviewer's comment in 10% of cases is of little value without knowing what was asked by the reviewer:","What if in all successful cases the code change required to address the comment was just the removal of an empty line?","In this paper we aim at characterizing the cases in which three code review automation techniques tend to succeed or fail in the two above-described tasks.","The study has a strong qualitative focus, with ~105 man-hours of manual inspection invested in manually analyzing correct and wrong predictions generated by the three techniques, for a total of 2,291 inspected predictions.","The output of this analysis are two taxonomies reporting, for each of the two tasks, the types of code changes on which the experimented techniques tend to succeed or to fail, pointing to areas for future work.","A result of our manual analysis was also the identification of several issues in the datasets used to train and test the experimented techniques.","Finally, we assess the importance of researching in techniques specialized for code review automation by comparing their performance with ChatGPT, a general purpose large language model, finding that ChatGPT struggles in commenting code as a human reviewer would do."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05136v1"}
{"created":"2024-01-10 12:56:47","title":"Yes, this is what I was looking for! Towards Multi-modal Medical Consultation Concern Summary Generation","abstract":"Over the past few years, the use of the Internet for healthcare-related tasks has grown by leaps and bounds, posing a challenge in effectively managing and processing information to ensure its efficient utilization. During moments of emotional turmoil and psychological challenges, we frequently turn to the internet as our initial source of support, choosing this over discussing our feelings with others due to the associated social stigma. In this paper, we propose a new task of multi-modal medical concern summary (MMCS) generation, which provides a short and precise summary of patients' major concerns brought up during the consultation. Nonverbal cues, such as patients' gestures and facial expressions, aid in accurately identifying patients' concerns. Doctors also consider patients' personal information, such as age and gender, in order to describe the medical condition appropriately. Motivated by the potential efficacy of patients' personal context and visual gestures, we propose a transformer-based multi-task, multi-modal intent-recognition, and medical concern summary generation (IR-MMCSG) system. Furthermore, we propose a multitasking framework for intent recognition and medical concern summary generation for doctor-patient consultations. We construct the first multi-modal medical concern summary generation (MM-MediConSummation) corpus, which includes patient-doctor consultations annotated with medical concern summaries, intents, patient personal information, doctor's recommendations, and keywords. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate (a) the significant role of patients' expressions/gestures and their personal information in intent identification and medical concern summary generation, and (b) the strong correlation between intent recognition and patients' medical concern summary generation   The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MMCSG.","sentences":["Over the past few years, the use of the Internet for healthcare-related tasks has grown by leaps and bounds, posing a challenge in effectively managing and processing information to ensure its efficient utilization.","During moments of emotional turmoil and psychological challenges, we frequently turn to the internet as our initial source of support, choosing this over discussing our feelings with others due to the associated social stigma.","In this paper, we propose a new task of multi-modal medical concern summary (MMCS) generation, which provides a short and precise summary of patients' major concerns brought up during the consultation.","Nonverbal cues, such as patients' gestures and facial expressions, aid in accurately identifying patients' concerns.","Doctors also consider patients' personal information, such as age and gender, in order to describe the medical condition appropriately.","Motivated by the potential efficacy of patients' personal context and visual gestures, we propose a transformer-based multi-task, multi-modal intent-recognition, and medical concern summary generation (IR-MMCSG) system.","Furthermore, we propose a multitasking framework for intent recognition and medical concern summary generation for doctor-patient consultations.","We construct the first multi-modal medical concern summary generation (MM-MediConSummation) corpus, which includes patient-doctor consultations annotated with medical concern summaries, intents, patient personal information, doctor's recommendations, and keywords.","Our experiments and analysis demonstrate (a) the significant role of patients' expressions/gestures and their personal information in intent identification and medical concern summary generation, and (b) the strong correlation between intent recognition and patients' medical concern summary generation   The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MMCSG."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05134v1"}

{"created":"2025-05-27 15:48:17","title":"Towards Robust Automated Perceptual Voice Quality Assessment with Speech Foundation Models","abstract":"Perceptual voice quality assessment is essential for diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders. Traditionally, expert raters use scales such as the CAPE-V and GRBAS. However, these are subjective and prone to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated, objective assessment methods. This study proposes VOQANet, a deep learning framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to extract high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To improve robustness and interpretability, we introduce VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings into a hybrid representation. Unlike prior work focusing only on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A subset) from the Perceptual Voice Quality Dataset (PVQD), we evaluate our models on both vowel-based and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S subset) for better generalizability. Results show that sentence-based input outperforms vowel-based input, particularly at the patient level, highlighting the benefit of longer utterances for capturing voice attributes. VOQANet consistently surpasses baseline methods in root mean squared error and Pearson correlation across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving further improvements. Additional tests under noisy conditions show that VOQANet+ maintains high prediction accuracy, supporting its use in real-world and telehealth settings. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features for interpretable and robust voice quality assessment.","sentences":["Perceptual voice quality assessment is essential for diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders.","Traditionally, expert raters use scales such as the CAPE-V and GRBAS.","However, these are subjective and prone to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated, objective assessment methods.","This study proposes VOQANet, a deep learning framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to extract high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech.","To improve robustness and interpretability, we introduce VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings into a hybrid representation.","Unlike prior work focusing only on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A subset) from the Perceptual Voice Quality Dataset (PVQD), we evaluate our models on both vowel-based and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S subset) for better generalizability.","Results show that sentence-based input outperforms vowel-based input, particularly at the patient level, highlighting the benefit of longer utterances for capturing voice attributes.","VOQANet consistently surpasses baseline methods in root mean squared error and Pearson correlation across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving further improvements.","Additional tests under noisy conditions show that VOQANet+ maintains high prediction accuracy, supporting its use in real-world and telehealth settings.","These findings demonstrate the value of combining SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features for interpretable and robust voice quality assessment."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21356v2"}

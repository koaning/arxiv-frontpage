                  <p>Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), their integration with traditional supervised machine learning (ML) techniques that have proven applicability to medical data remains underexplored.This is particularly true for psychiatric applications, where narrative data often exhibit nuanced linguistic and contextual complexity, and can benefit from the combination of multiple models with differing characteristics.In this study, we introduce an ensemble framework for automatically classifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (binary) using narrative transcripts.Our approach integrates three complementary models: LLaMA3, an open-source LLM that captures long-range semantic structure; RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on labeled clinical narratives; and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using TF-IDF-based lexical features.These models are aggregated through a majority voting mechanism to enhance predictive robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset includes 441 instances, including 352 for training and 89 for validation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Empirical results show that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving an F$_1$ score of 0.71 (95\% CI:[0.60-0.80]).Compared to the best-performing individual model (SVM), the ensemble improved recall while maintaining competitive precision.This indicates the strong sensitivity of the ensemble in identifying ADHD-related linguistic cues.These findings demonstrate the promise of hybrid architectures that leverage the semantic richness of LLMs alongside the interpretability and pattern recognition capabilities of traditional supervised ML, offering a new direction for robust and generalizable psychiatric text classification.</p>

                  <p>Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention.If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office.In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection.The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date.   We introduce PEDANTIC (\underline{P}at\underline{e}nt \underline{D}efiniteness Ex\underline{a}mi\underline{n}a\underline{ti}on \underline{C}orpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness.We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness.A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations.To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason.We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons.PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will publicly release the dataset and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robust robot manipulation in unstructured environments often requires understanding object properties that extend beyond geometry, such as material or compliance-properties that can be challenging to infer using vision alone.Multimodal haptic sensing provides a promising avenue for inferring such properties, yet progress has been constrained by the lack of large, diverse, and realistic haptic datasets.In this work, we introduce the CLAMP device, a low-cost (<\$200) sensorized reacher-grabber designed to collect large-scale, in-the-wild multimodal haptic data from non-expert users in everyday settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We deployed 16 CLAMP devices to 41 participants, resulting in the CLAMP dataset, the largest open-source multimodal haptic dataset to date, comprising 12.3 million datapoints across 5357 household objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>Using this dataset, we train a haptic encoder that can infer material and compliance object properties from multimodal haptic data.We leverage this encoder to create the CLAMP model, a visuo-haptic perception model for material recognition that generalizes to novel objects and three robot embodiments with minimal finetuning.We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in three real-world robot manipulation tasks: sorting recyclable and non-recyclable waste, retrieving objects from a cluttered bag, and distinguishing overripe from ripe bananas.Our results show that large-scale, in-the-wild haptic data collection can unlock new capabilities for generalizable robot manipulation.Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/clamp/</p>

                  <p>Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page.To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes.Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment.In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning.Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens.It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005.These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Paper2Poster/Paper2Poster. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span></p>

                  <p>Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various visual perception tasks.However, the inherent limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving.To enhance geometric understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity.We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving.Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks.Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o.We further study the impact of different negative sample construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a diagnosis.To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA.To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2) a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review, to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The resulting dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in 3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question is accompanied by two to five images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span>We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA.The evaluation challengingly reveals that all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy fluctuates as the number of images per question increases.Error analysis further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and modalities.We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded, multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI systems.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome rewards.However, this paradigm typically lacks supervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result, the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its generalization ability.In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm.To achieve this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the entire thinking process.Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training.This weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of potentially unreliable thinking rewards.Moreover, we design an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time, allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in later training stages.Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU), demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities.Notably, our SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite the latter having 10 times more parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code, models, and datasets are made publicly available at https://github.com/kxfan2002/SophiaVL-R1. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has permanently altered workplace structures, making remote work a widespread practice.While many employees advocate for flexibility, many employers reconsider their attitude toward remote work and opt for structured return-to-office mandates.Media headlines repeatedly emphasize that the corporate world is returning to full-time office work.This study examines how companies employing software engineers and supporting roles regulate work location, whether corporate policies have evolved in the last five years, and, if so, how, and why.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collected data on remote work regulation from corporate HR and/or management representatives from 68 corporate entities that vary in size, location, and orientation towards remote or office work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Our findings reveal that although many companies prioritize office-centred working (50%), most companies in our sample permit hybrid working to varying degrees (85%).Remote work regulation does not reveal any particular new "best practice" as policies differ greatly, but the single most popular arrangement was the three in-office days per week.More than half of the companies (51%) encourage or mandate office days, and more than quarter (28%) have changed regulations, gradually increasing the mandatory office presence or implementing differentiated conditions.Although no companies have increased flexibility, only four companies are returning to full-time office work.Our key recommendation for office-oriented companies is to consider a trust-based alternative to strict office presence mandates, while for companies oriented toward remote working, we warn about the points of no (or hard) return.Finally, the current state of policies is clearly not final, as companies continue to experiment and adjust their work regulation.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we describe a new type of match between a pattern and a text that aren't necessarily maximal in the query, but still contain useful matching information: locally maximal exact matches (LEMs).There are usually a large amount of LEMs, so we only consider those above some length threshold $\mathcal{L}$. These are referred to as long LEMs.The purpose of long LEMs is to capture substring matches between a query and a text that are not necessarily maximal in the pattern but still long enough to be important.Therefore efficient long LEMs finding algorithms are desired for these datasets.However, these datasets are too large to query on traditional string indexes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Fortunately, these datasets are very repetitive. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Recently, compressed string indexes that take advantage of the redundancy in the data but retain efficient querying capability have been proposed as a solution.We therefore give an efficient algorithm for computing all the long LEMs of a query and a text in a BWT runs compressed string index.We describe an $O(m+occ)$ expected time algorithm that relies on an $O(r)$ words space string index for outputting all long LEMs of a pattern with respect to a text given the matching statistics of the pattern with respect to the text.Here $m$ is the length of the query, $occ$ is the number of long LEMs outputted, and $r$ is the number of runs in the BWT of the text.The $O(r)$ space string index we describe relies on an adaptation of the move data structure by Nishimoto and Tabei.We are able to support $LCP[i]$ queries in constant time given $SA[i]$. In other words, we answer $PLCP[i]$ queries in constant time.Long LEMs may provide useful similarity information between a pattern and a text that MEMs may ignore.This information is particularly useful in pangenome and biobank scale haplotype panel contexts.</p>

                  <p>Current medical retrieval benchmarks primarily emphasize lexical or shallow semantic similarity, overlooking the reasoning-intensive demands that are central to clinical decision-making.In practice, physicians often retrieve authoritative medical evidence to support diagnostic hypotheses.Such evidence typically aligns with an inferred diagnosis rather than the surface form of a patient's symptoms, leading to low lexical or semantic overlap between queries and relevant documents.To address this gap, we introduce R2MED, the first benchmark explicitly designed for reasoning-driven medical retrieval.It comprises 876 queries spanning three tasks: Q&A reference retrieval, clinical evidence retrieval, and clinical case retrieval.These tasks are drawn from five representative medical scenarios and twelve body systems, capturing the complexity and diversity of real-world medical information needs.We evaluate 15 widely-used retrieval systems on R2MED and find that even the best model achieves only 31.4 nDCG@10, demonstrating the benchmark's difficulty.Classical re-ranking and generation-augmented retrieval methods offer only modest improvements.Although large reasoning models improve performance via intermediate inference generation, the best results still peak at 41.4 nDCG@10.These findings underscore a substantial gap between current retrieval techniques and the reasoning demands of real clinical tasks.We release R2MED as a challenging benchmark to foster the development of next-generation medical retrieval systems with enhanced reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at https://github.com/R2MED/R2MED <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention.If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office.In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection.The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date.   We introduce PEDANTIC (\underline{P}at\underline{e}nt \underline{D}efiniteness Ex\underline{a}mi\underline{n}a\underline{ti}on \underline{C}orpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness.We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason.We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons.PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models.We will publicly release the dataset and code.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.This progress naturally raises a question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner comparable to human experts?However, existing video benchmarks primarily evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues.Such benchmarks do not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a conclusion.To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.Video-Holmes consists of 1,837 questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans seven carefully designed tasks.Each task is constructed by first identifying key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual clues scattered across different video segments.Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating information and often miss critical clues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models scoring below 40%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark is released in https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

                  <p>Collision-free motion planning for redundant robot manipulators in complex environments is yet to be explored.Although recent advancements at the intersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robotics have highlighted its potential to handle versatile robotic tasks, current DRL-based collision-free motion planners for manipulators are highly costly, hindering their deployment and application.This is due to an overreliance on the minimum distance between the manipulator and obstacles, inadequate exploration and decision-making by DRL, and inefficient data acquisition and utilization.In this article, we propose URPlanner, a universal paradigm for collision-free robotic motion planning based on DRL.URPlanner offers several advantages over existing approaches: it is platform-agnostic, cost-effective in both training and deployment, and applicable to arbitrary manipulators without solving inverse kinematics.To achieve this, we first develop a parameterized task space and a universal obstacle avoidance reward that is independent of minimum distance.Second, we introduce an augmented policy exploration and evaluation algorithm that can be applied to various DRL algorithms to enhance their performance.Third, we propose an expert data diffusion strategy for efficient policy learning, which can produce a large-scale trajectory dataset from only a few expert demonstrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the superiority of the proposed methods is comprehensively verified through experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-Domain Recommendation (MDR) achieves the desirable recommendation performance by effectively utilizing the transfer information across different domains.Despite the great success, most existing MDR methods adopt a single structure to transfer complex domain-shared knowledge.However, the beneficial transferring information should vary across different domains.When there is knowledge conflict between domains or a domain is of poor quality, unselectively leveraging information from all domains will lead to a serious Negative Transfer Problem (NTP).Therefore, how to effectively model the complex transfer relationships between domains to avoid NTP is still a direction worth exploring.To address these issues, we propose a simple and dynamic Similar Domain Selection Principle (SDSP) for multi-domain recommendation in this paper.SDSP presents the initial exploration of selecting suitable domain knowledge for each domain to alleviate NTP.Specifically, we propose a novel prototype-based domain distance measure to effectively model the complexity relationship between domains.Thereafter, the proposed SDSP can dynamically find similar domains for each domain based on the supervised signals of the domain metrics and the unsupervised distance measure from the learned domain prototype.We emphasize that SDSP is a lightweight method that can be incorporated with existing MDR methods for better performance while not introducing excessive time overheads.To the best of our knowledge, it is the first solution that can explicitly measure domain-level gaps and dynamically select appropriate domains in the MDR field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare.A major challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection, privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors.Previous methods typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to compensate for missing modalities.However, obtaining real datasets for every disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high dimensionality of medical data.In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight, low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the missing modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>The code and implementation details are available at: https://github.com/bhattarailab/FedFeatGen</p>

                  <p>Solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) (e.g., traveling salesman problems (TSPs) and capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs)) in practice traditionally involves handcrafting heuristics or specifying a search space for finding effective heuristics.The main challenges from these approaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and implementation efforts required from human experts.Recently, significant progress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large language models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined generalized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and guided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori information on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP and CVRP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield impressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still require considerable manual interventions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic design methods to operate without the need of GAFs.More specifically, RedAHD employs LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP at hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based heuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving the transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP.Our experimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of designing heuristics with competitive or improved results over the state-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability.However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process.Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory.As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality.To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference.PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps.The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

Text-to-SQL benchmarks such as SPIDER and Bird contain extensive metadata that is generally not available in practice.Human-generated metadata requires the use of expensive Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), who are often not fully aware of many aspects of their databases.In this paper, we explore techniques for automatic metadata extraction to enable text-to-SQL generation.

                  <p>In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Large Language Model (DMLLM).We observe that training with a purely discrete diffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal performance, and severe length bias issues.To address these challenges, we design a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase with a subsequent diffusion phase.This approach yields the Dimple-7B model, trained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as LLaVA-NEXT.Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%, demonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of autoregressive models.To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding strategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of tokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation iterations.In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during generation equals the response length.With confident decoding, however, the number of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\frac{\text{response length}}{3}$.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive models and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on most benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Additionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response using structure priors.These priors enable structured responses in a manner distinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow fine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to achieve in autoregressive models.Overall, this work validates the feasibility and advantages of DMLLM and enhances its inference efficiency and controllability.Code and models are available at https://github.com/yu-rp/Dimple.</p>

                  <p>The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g., image and video).However, as input complexity increases, particularly with long video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly, leading to quadratically computational costs.This has made the efficient compression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a pressing research challenge.In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling long video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which substantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance degradation.Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction from pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology.Then, within LLM layers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the pooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set.This module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining fine-grained informational fidelity.In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through interaction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension of the text tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based LMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major technological advancements of this century, bearing incredible potential for users through AI-powered applications and tools in numerous domains.Being often black-box (i.e., its decision-making process is unintelligible), developers typically resort to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the behaviour of AI models to produce systems that are transparent, fair, reliable, and trustworthy.However, presenting explanations to the user is not trivial and is often left as a secondary aspect of the system's design process, leading to AI systems that are not useful to end-users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review on Explanation User Interfaces (XUIs) to gain a deeper understanding of the solutions and design guidelines employed in the academic literature to effectively present explanations to users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To improve the contribution and real-world impact of this survey, we also present a framework for Human-cEnteRed developMent of Explainable user interfaceS (HERMES) to guide practitioners and academics in the design and evaluation of XUIs.</p>

                  <p>AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming core building blocks of modern software systems.A wide range of frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various agents involved.Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and observability tools.In this work, we explore the use of process and causal discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing developer observability.This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the emergent variability in agent behavior.Additionally, we complement this with LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and unintended behavioral variability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that such instrumentation is essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and explicit definitions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation.However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before.Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation.Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding.Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent.We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval.Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis.Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

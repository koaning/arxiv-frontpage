                  <p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks.Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results.Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks.However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task.To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas.Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge.We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span></p>

Korea, and Egypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>Rather than imposing predefined mood categories, we implement a bottom-up, participant-driven approach to organically elicit culturally specific music-related mood terms.We then recruit another pool of human participants to collect 988,925 ratings for these culture-specific descriptors.Our analysis confirms the presence of a valence-arousal structure shared across cultures, yet also reveals significant divergences in how certain mood terms, despite being dictionary equivalents, are perceived cross-culturally.State-of-the-art multimodal models benefit substantially from fine-tuning on our cross-culturally balanced dataset, as evidenced by improved alignment with human evaluations - particularly in non-English contexts.More broadly, our findings inform the ongoing debate on the universality versus cultural specificity of emotional descriptors, and our methodology can contribute to other multimodal and cross-lingual research.</p>

                  <p>Video quality assessment (VQA) is essential for quantifying perceptual quality in various video processing workflows, spanning from camera capture systems to over-the-top streaming platforms.While recent supervised VQA models have made substantial progress, the reliance on manually annotated datasets -- a process that is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to scale up -- has hindered further optimization of their generalization to unseen video content and distortions.To bridge this gap, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework for VQA to learn quality assessment capabilities from large-scale, unlabeled web videos.Our approach leverages a \textbf{learning-to-rank} paradigm to train a large multimodal model (LMM) on video pairs automatically labeled via two manners, including quality pseudo-labeling by existing VQA models and relative quality ranking based on synthetic distortion simulations.Furthermore, we introduce a novel \textbf{iterative self-improvement training strategy}, where the trained model acts an improved annotator to iteratively refine the annotation quality of training data.By training on a dataset $10\times$ larger than the existing VQA benchmarks, our model: (1) achieves zero-shot performance on in-domain VQA benchmarks that matches or surpasses supervised models; (2) demonstrates superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization across diverse video content and distortions; and (3) sets a new state-of-the-art when fine-tuned on human-labeled datasets.Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our self-supervised approach in training generalized VQA models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and code will be publicly released to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or interpretable reasoning steps.This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases.To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models.Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models.We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors.We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and reasoning traces will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction.However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity.To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation.RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation.To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies.This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences.We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities.Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability.Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span></p>

                  <p>Surrogate regret bounds bridge the gap between the convergence rates of surrogate and target losses, with linear bounds favorable for their lossless regret transfer.While convex smooth surrogate losses are appealing in particular due to the efficient estimation and optimization, the existence of a trade-off between the smoothness and linear regret bound has been believed in the community.That being said, the better optimization and estimation properties of convex smooth surrogate losses may inevitably deteriorate after undergoing the regret transfer onto a target loss.We overcome this dilemma for arbitrary discrete target losses by constructing a convex smooth surrogate loss, which entails a linear surrogate regret bound composed with a tailored prediction link.The construction is based on Fenchel-Young losses generated by the convolutional negentropy, which are equivalent to the infimal convolution of a generalized negentropy and the target Bayes risk.Consequently, the infimal convolution enables us to derive a smooth loss while maintaining the surrogate regret bound linear.We additionally benefit from the infimal convolution to have a consistent estimator of the underlying class probability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results are overall a novel demonstration of how convex analysis penetrates into optimization and statistical efficiency in risk minimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

In this work, we introduce Multi-Source Data Transfer Protocol, MDTP, which further improves multi-source transfer performance.MDTP logically divides a file request into smaller chunk requests and distributes the chunk requests across multiple servers.Chunk sizes are adapted based on each server's performance but selected in a way that ensures each round of requests completes around the same time.We formulate this chunk-size allocation problem as a variant of the bin-packing problem, where adaptive chunking efficiently fills the available capacity "bins" corresponding to each server.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation shows that MDTP reduces transfer times by 10-22% compared to Aria2, the fastest alternative. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Comparisons with other protocols, such as static chunking and BitTorrent, demonstrate even greater improvements.Additionally, we show that MDTP distributes load proportionally across all available replicas, not just the fastest ones, which improves throughput.Finally, we show MDTP maintains high throughput even when latency increases or bandwidth to the fastest server decreases.</p>

                  <p>While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging.A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively.To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs.It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment.Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools.V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions.We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks.Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".</p>

                  <p>Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world scenarios.However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC theory, resulting in limited interpretability.Therefore, we propose AC-Reason, a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g., sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a theory-guided algorithm with explanations.While AC-Reason does not explicitly construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal structure to support principled reasoning.To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ).AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on actual causation.The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench present greater challenges for LLMs.Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over baselines.On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On AC-Bench, GPT-4 + AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>AC-Bench further enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts.Finally, our ablation study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.</p>

                  <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained popularity in various fields such as agriculture, emergency response, and search and rescue operations.UAV networks are susceptible to several security threats, such as wormhole, jamming, spoofing, and false data injection.Time Delay Attack (TDA) is a unique attack in which malicious UAVs intentionally delay packet forwarding, posing significant threats, especially in time-sensitive applications.It is challenging to distinguish malicious delay from benign network delay due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks, intermittent wireless connectivity, or the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) mechanism during multi-hop communication.Some existing works propose machine learning-based centralized approaches to detect TDA, which are computationally intensive and have large message overheads.This paper proposes a novel approach DATAMUt, where the temporal dynamics of the network are represented by a weighted time-window graph (TWiG), and then two deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are presented to detect TDA when UAVs have global and local network knowledge.Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms have reduced message overhead by a factor of five and twelve in global and local knowledge, respectively, compared to existing approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our approaches achieve approximately 860 and 1050 times less execution time in global and local knowledge, respectively, outperforming the existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization schemes deliver highly accurate location data by matching the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) with an offline database using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) models.However, over time, RSSI values degrade due to the malicious behavior of access points (APs), causing low positional accuracy due to RSSI value mismatch with the offline database.Existing literature lacks detection of malicious APs in the online phase and mitigating their effects.This research addresses these limitations and proposes a long-term reliable indoor localization scheme by incorporating malicious AP detection and their effect mitigation techniques.The proposed scheme uses a Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) classifier to estimate locations and integrates simple yet efficient techniques to detect malicious APs based on online query data.Subsequently, a mitigation technique is incorporated that updates the offline database and online queries by imputing stable values for malicious APs using LGBM Regressors.Additionally, we introduce a noise addition mechanism in the offline database to capture the dynamic environmental effects.Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed scheme attains a detection accuracy above 95% for each attack type.The mitigation strategy effectively restores the system's performance nearly to its original state when no malicious AP is present.The noise addition module reduces localization errors by nearly 16%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the proposed solution is lightweight, reducing the execution time by approximately 94% compared to the existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint.Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars.Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities.Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.</p>

                  <p>Many online platforms incorporate engagement signals--such as likes and upvotes--into their content ranking systems and interface design.These signals are designed to boost user engagement.However, they can unintentionally elevate content that is less inclusive and may not support normatively desirable behavior.This issue becomes especially concerning when toxic content correlates strongly with popularity indicators such as likes and upvotes.In this study, we propose structured prosocial feedback as a complementary signal to likes and upvotes--one that highlights content quality based on normative criteria to help address the limitations of conventional engagement signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by designing and implementing a machine learning feedback system powered by a large language model (LLM), which evaluates user comments based on principles of positive psychology, such as individual well-being, constructive social media use, and character strengths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>We then conduct a pre-registered user study to examine how existing peer-based and the new expert-based feedback interact to shape users' selection of comments in a social media setting.Results show that peer feedback increases conformity to popularity cues, while expert feedback shifts preferences toward normatively higher-quality content.Moreover, incorporating expert feedback alongside peer evaluations improves alignment with expert assessments and contributes to a less toxic community environment.This illustrates the added value of normative cues--such as expert scores generated by LLMs using psychological rubrics--and underscores the potential benefits of incorporating such signals into platform feedback systems to foster healthier online environments.</p>

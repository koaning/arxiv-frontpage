                  <p>Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next preferences based on their interaction histories, but existing approaches face critical limitations in efficiency and multi-scale pattern recognition.While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features.To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating.First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise.Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions.Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion.Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines.Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M2Rec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>The visually impaired population, especially the severely visually impaired, is currently large in scale, and daily activities pose significant challenges for them.Although many studies use large language and vision-language models to assist the blind, most focus on static content and fail to meet real-time perception needs in dynamic and complex environments, such as daily activities.To provide them with more effective intelligent assistance, it is imperative to incorporate advanced visual understanding technologies.Although real-time vision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual understanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness in assisting visually impaired individuals.In this work, we conduct the first such evaluation.First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily), covering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals: Basic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks.The results show that GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate.Next, we conduct a user study to evaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further exploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts.One key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving potential hazards in dynamic environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we build an environment-awareness dataset named SafeVid and introduce a polling mechanism that enables the model to proactively detect environmental risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.</p>

                  <p>Video quality assessment (VQA) is essential for quantifying perceptual quality in various video processing workflows, spanning from camera capture systems to over-the-top streaming platforms.While recent supervised VQA models have made substantial progress, the reliance on manually annotated datasets -- a process that is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to scale up -- has hindered further optimization of their generalization to unseen video content and distortions.To bridge this gap, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework for VQA to learn quality assessment capabilities from large-scale, unlabeled web videos.Our approach leverages a \textbf{learning-to-rank} paradigm to train a large multimodal model (LMM) on video pairs automatically labeled via two manners, including quality pseudo-labeling by existing VQA models and relative quality ranking based on synthetic distortion simulations.Furthermore, we introduce a novel \textbf{iterative self-improvement training strategy}, where the trained model acts an improved annotator to iteratively refine the annotation quality of training data.By training on a dataset $10\times$ larger than the existing VQA benchmarks, our model: (1) achieves zero-shot performance on in-domain VQA benchmarks that matches or surpasses supervised models; (2) demonstrates superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization across diverse video content and distortions; and (3) sets a new state-of-the-art when fine-tuned on human-labeled datasets.Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our self-supervised approach in training generalized VQA models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and code will be publicly released to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of user-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts and contextual captioning.However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding.To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable.Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them.Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span>Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways.We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space.We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings.The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs.We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs.Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the codes and datasets are released at: https://github.com/xyfyyds/ReGraP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gait recognition has emerged as a powerful tool for unobtrusive and long-range identity analysis, with growing relevance in surveillance and monitoring applications.Although recent advances in deep learning and large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate recognition under closed-set conditions, real-world deployment demands open-set gait enrollment, which means determining whether a new gait sample corresponds to a known identity or represents a previously unseen individual.In this work, we introduce a transformer-based framework for open-set gait enrollment that is both dataset-agnostic and recognition-architecture-agnostic.Our method leverages a SetTransformer to make enrollment decisions based on the embedding of a probe sample and a context set drawn from the gallery, without requiring task-specific thresholds or retraining for new environments.By decoupling enrollment from the main recognition pipeline, our model is generalized across different datasets, gallery sizes, and identity distributions.We propose an evaluation protocol that uses existing datasets in different ratios of identities and walks per identity.We instantiate our method using skeleton-based gait representations and evaluate it on two benchmark datasets (CASIA-B and PsyMo), using embeddings from three state-of-the-art recognition models (GaitGraph, GaitFormer, and GaitPT).We show that our method is flexible, is able to accurately perform enrollment in different scenarios, and scales better with data compared to traditional approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make the code and dataset scenarios publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction.However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity.To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation.RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation.To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies.This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences.We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities.Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability.Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating responsive listener head dynamics with nuanced emotions and expressive reactions is crucial for practical dialogue modeling in various virtual avatar animations.Previous studies mainly focus on the direct short-term production of listener behavior.They overlook the fine-grained control over motion variations and emotional intensity, especially in long-sequence modeling.Moreover, the lack of long-term and large-scale paired speaker-listener corpora including head dynamics and fine-grained multi-modality annotations (e.g., text-based expression descriptions, emotional intensity) also limits the application of dialogue modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we first newly collect a large-scale multi-turn dataset of 3D dyadic conversation containing more than 1.4M valid frames for multi-modal responsive interaction, dubbed ListenerX. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Additionally, we propose VividListener, a novel framework enabling fine-grained, expressive and controllable listener dynamics modeling.This framework leverages multi-modal conditions as guiding principles for fostering coherent interactions between speakers and listeners.Specifically, we design the Responsive Interaction Module (RIM) to adaptively represent the multi-modal interactive embeddings.RIM ensures the listener dynamics achieve fine-grained semantic coordination with textual descriptions and adjustments, while preserving expressive reaction with speaker behavior.Meanwhile, we design the Emotional Intensity Tags (EIT) for emotion intensity editing with multi-modal information integration, applying to both text descriptions and listener motion amplitude.Extensive experiments conducted on our newly collected ListenerX dataset demonstrate that VividListener achieves state-of-the-art performance, realizing expressive and controllable listener dynamics.</p>

                  <p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs).While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs.The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities.To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training.By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores.Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>In 2021, the City of Atlanta and Atlanta Police Foundation launched plans to build a large police training facility in the South River Forest in unincorporated DeKalb County, GA.Residents of Atlanta and DeKalb County, environmental activists, police and prison abolitionists, and other activists and concerned individuals formed the movement in opposition to the facility, known as the Stop Cop City / Defend the Atlanta Forest movement.Social media and digital maps became common tools for communicating information about the facility and the movement.Here, we examine online maps about the facility and the opposition movement, originating from grassroots organizations, the City of Atlanta, news media outlets, the Atlanta Police Foundation, and individuals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We gather and examine 32 publicly available maps collected through the Google Search API, Twitter (now X), Instagram and reddit. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>Using a framework of critical cartography, we conduct a content analysis of these maps to identify the mapping technologies and techniques (data, cartographic elements, styles) used by different stakeholders and roles that maps and mapping technologies can play in social movements.We examine the extent to which these maps provide data to confirm or contradict concerns raised by grassroots organizations and local residents about the facility.We find that stakeholders and mapmakers use geospatial tools in different ways and likely have varied access to mapping technologies.We argue that documenting the use of maps to communicate information about a contentious project can help enumerate community positions and perspectives, and we advocate for accessible mapmaking tools.We conclude by discussing the implications of accessibility of mapping technology and posting maps to social media, and share example map images that extend the geographic information systems (GIS) techniques seen in the retrieved maps.</p>

                  <p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations.In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp.However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection).In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data.To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available.PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task.Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.</p>

To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks, (ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and (iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.

                  <p>In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development.The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities.These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation.However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models.Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash.More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction.A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions.Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.</p>

                  <p>Semi-supervised learning has become a compelling approach for 3D tooth segmentation from CBCT scans, where labeled data is minimal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing methods still face two persistent challenges: limited corrective supervision in structurally ambiguous or mislabeled regions during supervised training and performance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>To address these problems, we propose Region-Aware Instructive Learning (RAIL), a dual-group dual-student, semi-supervised framework.Each group contains two student models guided by a shared teacher network.By alternating training between the two groups, RAIL promotes intergroup knowledge transfer and collaborative region-aware instruction while reducing overfitting to the characteristics of any single model.Specifically, RAIL introduces two instructive mechanisms.Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller improves supervised learning by instructing predictions only within areas where student outputs diverge from both ground truth and the best student, thereby concentrating supervision on structurally ambiguous or mislabeled areas.In the unsupervised phase, Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator reinforces agreement in regions with high model certainty while reducing the effect of low-confidence predictions during training.This helps prevent our model from learning unstable patterns and improves the overall reliability of pseudo-labels.Extensive experiments on four CBCT tooth segmentation datasets show that RAIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods under limited annotation.Our code will be available at https://github.com/Tournesol-Saturday/RAIL.</p>

                  <p>Over the past decades, a tremendous amount of work has addressed the topic of ego-motion estimation of moving platforms based on various proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors.At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and sensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of accuracy with minimal drift in various conditions.In this paper, we question the need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the accuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel encoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope.We denote this algorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry.This work shows that OG odometry can outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a fraction of the computational cost in most scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, the OG odometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error of 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Lidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the computational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry.To further the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely violating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a heavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours.Our conclusion shows that a significant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose estimates from the OG odometry.</p>

                  <p>Accurate state estimation is essential for effective control of robots.For soft robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states are inherently infinite-dimensional functions due to the robots' continuous deformability.Traditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide discrete measurements.Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a boundary observer was introduced, which leverages Cosserat rod theory to recover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the velocity twist at the robot's tip.In this work, we present a novel boundary observer that can also recover infinite-dimensional dynamic states, but instead relies on measuring the internal wrench at the robot's base.This design exploits the duality between the velocity twist at the tip and the internal wrench at the base, with both types of boundary observers being inspired by principles of energy dissipation.Despite the mathematical duality, the proposed approach offers a distinct advantage: it requires only a 6-axis force/torque sensor embedded at the base, eliminating the need for external sensing systems such as motion capture cameras.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, combining both tip- and base-based techniques enhances energy dissipation, accelerates convergence, and improves estimation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>We validate the proposed algorithms through both simulation studies and experiments based on tendon-driven continuum robots.Our results demonstrate that all boundary observers converge to the ground truth within 3 seconds, even with significantly deviated initial conditions.Furthermore, they recover from unknown perturbations and effectively track high-frequency vibrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that combining the dual techniques further improves convergence speed and accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Finally, the computational efficiency of these algorithms indicates their feasibility for real-time state estimation.</p>

We provide complexity bounds for three variations of AdaGrad, which show at least a quadratic dependence on problem parameters $\Delta, L_0, L_1$. Notably, we show that the decorrelated variant of AdaGrad-Norm requires at least $\Omega \left( \Delta^2 L_1^2 \sigma^2 \epsilon^{-4} \right)$ stochastic gradient queries to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point.We also provide a lower bound for SGD with a broad class of adaptive stepsizes.Our results show that, for certain adaptive algorithms, the $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth setting is fundamentally more difficult than the standard smooth setting, in terms of the initial optimality gap and the smoothness constants.</p>

                  <p>The analysis of network assortativity is of great importance for understanding the structural characteristics of and dynamics upon networks.Often, network assortativity is quantified using the assortativity coefficient that is defined based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between vertex degrees.It is well known that a network may contain sensitive information, such as the number of friends of an individual in a social network (which is abstracted as the degree of vertex.).So, the computation of the assortativity coefficient leads to privacy leakage, which increases the urgent need for privacy-preserving protocol.However, there has been no scheme addressing the concern above.   To bridge this gap, in this work, we are the first to propose approaches based on differential privacy (DP for short).Specifically, we design three DP-based algorithms: $Local_{ru}$, $Shuffle_{ru}$, and $Decentral_{ru}$. The first two algorithms, based on Local DP (LDP) and Shuffle DP respectively, are designed for settings where each individual only knows his/her direct friends.In contrast, the third algorithm, based on Decentralized DP (DDP), targets scenarios where each individual has a broader view, i.e., also knowing his/her friends' friends.Theoretically, we prove that each algorithm enables an unbiased estimation of the assortativity coefficient of the network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms using mean squared error (MSE), showing that $Shuffle_{ru}$ achieves the best performance, followed by $Decentral_{ru}$, with $Local_{ru}$ performing the worst. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Note that these three algorithms have different assumptions, so each has its applicability scenario.Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical simulations, which demonstrate that the presented approaches are adequate to achieve the estimation of network assortativity under the demand for privacy protection.</p>

                  <p>Harmonization of T1-weighted MR images across different scanners is crucial for ensuring consistency in neuroimaging studies.This study introduces a novel approach to direct image harmonization, moving beyond feature standardization to ensure that extracted features remain inherently reliable for downstream analysis.Our method enables image transfer in two ways: (1) mapping images to a scanner-free space for uniform appearance across all scanners, and (2) transforming images into the domain of a specific scanner used in model training, embedding its unique characteristics.Our approach presents strong generalization capability, even for unseen scanners not included in the training phase.We validated our method using MR images from diverse cohorts, including healthy controls, traveling subjects, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD).The model's effectiveness is tested in multiple applications, such as brain age prediction (R2 = 0.60 \pm 0.05), biomarker extraction, AD classification (Test Accuracy = 0.86 \pm 0.03), and diagnosis prediction (AUC = 0.95).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In all cases, our harmonization technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in both reliability and predictive accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Moreover, our approach eliminates the need for extensive preprocessing steps, such as skull-stripping, which can introduce errors by misclassifying brain and non-brain structures.This makes our method particularly suitable for applications that require full-head analysis, including research on head trauma and cranial deformities.Additionally, our harmonization model does not require retraining for new datasets, allowing smooth integration into various neuroimaging workflows.By ensuring scanner-invariant image quality, our approach provides a robust and efficient solution for improving neuroimaging studies across diverse settings.The code is available at this link.</p>

                  <p>Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendations.However, we identify potential bottlenecks in two foundational components.First, the embedding layer leads to a latent space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially valuable preference patterns.Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a fine-grained manner.Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum and a restricted linear form.To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a CF framework based on graph spectral filtering.Instead of a learned embedding, it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of signals contained in it.Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.</p>

                  <p>In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can significantly impact outcomes.Objects that are heavily occluded or intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human observation or through advanced technological applications.While certain Deep Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in handling distant information, e.g., transformers.In X-ray security imaging the literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been sufficiently explored.In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline, namely YOLOv8.In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer (Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR).The resulting architectures are comparatively evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS, HiXray, and PIDray.Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer architectures exhibit increased robustness.Detailed comparative evaluation results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural combination and suggest guidelines for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and network weights of the models employed in this study are available at https://github.com/jgenc/xray-comparative-evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series.However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values.The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights.To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling.Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or interpretable reasoning steps.This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases.To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models.Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces.Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors.We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors.The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and reasoning traces will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva.</p>

                  <p>Sparse large language models (LLMs) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) and close to a trillion parameters are dominating the realm of most capable language models.However, the massive model scale poses significant challenges for the underlying software and hardware systems.In this paper, we aim to uncover a recipe to harness such scale on Ascend NPUs.The key goals are better usage of the computing resources under the dynamic sparse model structures and materializing the expected performance gain on the actual hardware.To select model configurations suitable for Ascend NPUs without repeatedly running the expensive experiments, we leverage simulation to compare the trade-off of various model hyperparameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study led to Pangu Ultra MoE, a sparse LLM with 718 billion parameters, and we conducted experiments on the model to verify the simulation results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>On the system side, we dig into Expert Parallelism to optimize the communication between NPU devices to reduce the synchronization overhead.We also optimize the memory efficiency within the devices to further reduce the parameter and activation management overhead.In the end, we achieve an MFU of 30.0% when training Pangu Ultra MoE, with performance comparable to that of DeepSeek R1, on 6K Ascend NPUs, and demonstrate that the Ascend system is capable of harnessing all the training stages of the state-of-the-art language models.Extensive experiments indicate that our recipe can lead to efficient training of large-scale sparse language models with MoE. We also study the behaviors of such models for future reference.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

                  <p>Gait recognition has emerged as a powerful tool for unobtrusive and long-range identity analysis, with growing relevance in surveillance and monitoring applications.Although recent advances in deep learning and large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate recognition under closed-set conditions, real-world deployment demands open-set gait enrollment, which means determining whether a new gait sample corresponds to a known identity or represents a previously unseen individual.In this work, we introduce a transformer-based framework for open-set gait enrollment that is both dataset-agnostic and recognition-architecture-agnostic.Our method leverages a SetTransformer to make enrollment decisions based on the embedding of a probe sample and a context set drawn from the gallery, without requiring task-specific thresholds or retraining for new environments.By decoupling enrollment from the main recognition pipeline, our model is generalized across different datasets, gallery sizes, and identity distributions.We propose an evaluation protocol that uses existing datasets in different ratios of identities and walks per identity.We instantiate our method using skeleton-based gait representations and evaluate it on two benchmark datasets (CASIA-B and PsyMo), using embeddings from three state-of-the-art recognition models (GaitGraph, GaitFormer, and GaitPT).We show that our method is flexible, is able to accurately perform enrollment in different scenarios, and scales better with data compared to traditional approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make the code and dataset scenarios publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction.However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity.To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation.RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation.To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies.This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences.We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities.Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability.Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span></p>

                  <p>It is well known that machine learning models require a high amount of annotated data to obtain optimal performance.Labelling Computed Tomography (CT) data can be a particularly challenging task due to its volumetric nature and often missing and$/$or incomplete associated meta-data.Even inspecting one CT scan requires additional computer software, or in the case of programming languages $-$ additional programming libraries.This study proposes a simple, yet effective approach based on 2D X-ray-like estimation of 3D CT scans for body region identification.Although body region is commonly associated with the CT scan, it often describes only the focused major body region neglecting other anatomical regions present in the observed CT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the proposed approach, estimated 2D images were utilized to identify 14 distinct body regions, providing valuable information for constructing a high-quality medical dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it was compared against 2.5D, 3D and foundation model (MI2) based approaches.Our approach outperformed the others, where it came on top with statistical significance and F1-Score for the best-performing model EffNet-B0 of 0.980 $\pm$ 0.016 in comparison to the 0.840 $\pm$ 0.114 (2.5D DenseNet-161), 0.854 $\pm$ 0.096 (3D VoxCNN), and 0.852 $\pm$ 0.104 (MI2 foundation model).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The utilized dataset comprised three different clinical centers and counted 15,622 CT scans (44,135 labels). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span></p>

                  <p>Black-box scanners have played a significant role in detecting vulnerabilities for web applications.A key focus in current black-box scanning is increasing test coverage (i.e., accessing more web pages).However, since many web applications are user-oriented, some deep pages can only be accessed through complex user interactions, which are difficult to reach by existing black-box scanners.To fill this gap, a key insight is that web pages contain a wealth of semantic information that can aid in understanding potential user intention.Based on this insight, we propose Hoyen, a black-box scanner that uses the Large Language Model to predict user intention and provide guidance for expanding the scanning scope.Hoyen has been rigorously evaluated on 12 popular open-source web applications and compared with 6 representative tools.The results demonstrate that Hoyen performs a comprehensive exploration of web applications, expanding the attack surface while achieving about 2x than the coverage of other scanners on average, with high request accuracy.Furthermore, Hoyen detected over 90% of its requests towards the core functionality of the application, detecting more vulnerabilities than other scanners, including unique vulnerabilities in well-known web applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data/code is available at https://hoyen.tjunsl.com/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs).While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs.The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities.To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training.By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores.Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations.In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp.However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection).In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data.To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available.PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task.Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.</p>

                  <p>Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced "Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to understand human activities in real-world settings.DARai consists of continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10 different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors, biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.   To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks, (ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and (iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.   Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels.To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/software-and-datasets/darai-daily-activity-recordings-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>Flaky tests produce inconsistent outcomes without code changes, creating major challenges for software developers.An industrial case study reported that developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly cost of $2,250.We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with co-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic flakiness.This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing shared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather than tackling them individually.This study represents an inflection point by challenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated occurrences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24 Java projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job scheduling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>It contains 810 flaky tests, which we levered to perform a mixed-method empirical analysis of co-occurring flaky test failures.Systemic flakiness is significant and widespread.We performed agglomerative clustering of flaky tests based on their failure co-occurrence, finding that 75% of flaky tests across all projects belong to a cluster, with a mean cluster size of 13.5 flaky tests.Instead of requiring 10,000 test suite runs to identify systemic flakiness, we demonstrated a lightweight alternative by training machine learning models based on static test case distance measures.Through manual inspection of stack traces, conducted independently by four authors and resolved through negotiated agreement, we identified intermittent networking issues and instabilities in external dependencies as the predominant causes of systemic flakiness.</p>

                  <p>Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge.Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL).However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system.During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location.Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers.The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments.To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions.It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Topics over Time (ToT) model captures thematic changes in timestamped datasets by explicitly modeling publication dates jointly with word co-occurrence patterns.However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian fashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems.To address this issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the introduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution.This prior acts as a regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from unstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch.The characteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the first time.Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the single-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document.A variation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a solution.In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times per document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps along the inference process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have tested our models on two datasets: a collection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>The results show that WBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA topic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence over time is reduced by $51\%$ and $34\%$, respectively.Our experiments also demonstrate the superior coherence of WBToT over BToT, which highlights the importance of balancing the time and word modalities.Finally, we illustrate the stability of the online optimization algorithm in WBToT, which allows the application of WBToT to problems that are intractable for standard ToT.</p>

                  <p>C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems.However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases.We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation.By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files.The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness.We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques.We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust.The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting.Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate fetal brain tissue segmentation and biometric analysis are essential for studying brain development in utero.The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new task alongside tissue segmentation.For the first time, our diverse multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler characteristic difference (ED). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods, most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans.However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability.The ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores, highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with high-quality reconstruction.Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting reliable biometric estimates from image data alone.Domain shift analysis identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial role.Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site, had smaller, though still measurable, effects.Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically robust and generalizable AI tools.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance generation quality of the diffusion transformers.However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an additional and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process.In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components.We therefore propose Self-Representation A}lignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtain representation guidance through a self-distillation manner.Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only generative training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.</p>

                  <p>Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendations.However, we identify potential bottlenecks in two foundational components.First, the embedding layer leads to a latent space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially valuable preference patterns.Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a fine-grained manner.Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum and a restricted linear form.To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a CF framework based on graph spectral filtering.Instead of a learned embedding, it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of signals contained in it.Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.</p>

                  <p>In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can significantly impact outcomes.Objects that are heavily occluded or intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human observation or through advanced technological applications.While certain Deep Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in handling distant information, e.g., transformers.In X-ray security imaging the literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been sufficiently explored.In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline, namely YOLOv8.In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer (Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR).The resulting architectures are comparatively evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS, HiXray, and PIDray.Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer architectures exhibit increased robustness.Detailed comparative evaluation results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural combination and suggest guidelines for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and network weights of the models employed in this study are available at https://github.com/jgenc/xray-comparative-evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series.However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values.The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights.To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling.Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing logical deductions that can be made from trained information.These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some of these cases.Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning.To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data.The datasets are constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining, to create clean tests of generalization.We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization.We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge).We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Our results have implications for understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model.The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications.Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques.In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks.In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance.To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB.Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models.After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction.In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples.To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training across multiple parties while ensuring data privacy.Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), such as XGBoost, have gained popularity due to their high performance and strong interpretability.Therefore, there has been a growing interest in adapting XGBoost for use in federated settings via cryptographic techniques.However, it should be noted that these approaches may not always provide rigorous theoretical privacy guarantees, and they often come with a high computational cost in terms of time and space requirements.In this paper, we propose a variant of vertical federated XGBoost with bilateral differential privacy guarantee: MaskedXGBoost.We build well-calibrated noise to perturb the intermediate information to protect privacy.The noise is structured with part of its ingredients in the null space of the arithmetical operation for splitting score evaluation in XGBoost, helping us achieve consistently better utility than other perturbation methods and relatively lower overhead than encryption-based techniques.We provide theoretical utility analysis and empirically verify privacy preservation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared with other algorithms, our algorithm's superiority in both utility and efficiency has been validated on multiple datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in addressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks.However, recent studies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial attacks.Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real world, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks and enhance the robustness of GNNs.Despite the commendable performance of these defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural bias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail nodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes with low degree in the clean graph.Therefore, in this work, we propose a defense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN augmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to mitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks.Notably, the hetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low degree.To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is adopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of graph views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and debiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Salient Object Detection (SOD) methods can locate objects that stand out in an image, assign higher values to their pixels in a saliency map, and binarize the map outputting a predicted segmentation mask.A recent tendency is to investigate pre-trained lightweight models rather than deep neural networks in SOD tasks, coping with applications under limited computational resources.In this context, we have investigated lightweight networks using a methodology named Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), which assumes that the encoder's kernels can be estimated from marker pixels on discriminative regions of a few representative images.This work proposes flyweight networks, hundreds of times lighter than lightweight models, for SOD by combining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, whose weights are estimated for each input image by a given heuristic function.Such FLIM networks are trained from three to four representative images only and without backpropagation, making the models suitable for applications under labeled data constraints as well.We study five adaptive decoders; two of them are introduced here.Differently from the previous ones that rely on one neuron per pixel with shared weights, the heuristic functions of the new adaptive decoders estimate the weights of each neuron per pixel.We compare FLIM models with adaptive decoders for two challenging SOD tasks with three lightweight networks from the state-of-the-art, two FLIM networks with decoders trained by backpropagation, and one FLIM network whose labeled markers define the decoder's weights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed networks over the baselines, revealing the importance of further investigating such methods in new applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills.For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently.DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them.However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them.In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects.This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity.The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it.To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS.Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs.RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use.However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism.Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.   This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities.To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data.For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise.Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic.At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning.   Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern software systems are guided by hierarchical architectural concepts -- software architectures, reference architectures, and architectural frameworks -- each operating at a distinct level of abstraction.These artifacts promote reuse, scalability, and consistency, but also embed tradeoffs that shape critical quality attributes such as modifiability, performance, and security.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing evaluation methods, such as the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM), focus on system-specific architectures and are not designed to address the broader generality and variability of higher-level architectural forms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>To close this gap, we introduce the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF) -- a unified, scenario-driven framework for evaluating tradeoffs and risks across architectural levels.ATRAF encompasses three methods: the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (ATRAM), extending ATAM with enhanced risk identification for concrete systems; the Reference Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (RATRAM), adapting ATRAM to the evaluation of domain-level reference architectures; and the Architectural Framework Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (AFTRAM), supporting the evaluation of architectural frameworks that guide entire system families.All three methods follow an iterative spiral process that enables the identification of sensitivities, tradeoffs, and risks while supporting continuous refinement of architectural artifacts.We demonstrate ATRAF through progressively abstracted examples derived from the Remote Temperature Sensor (RTS) case, originally introduced in the ATAM literature.ATRAF equips architects, reference modelers, and framework designers with a practical, systematic approach for analyzing design alternatives and managing quality attribute tradeoffs early in the lifecycle and across all levels of architectural abstraction.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

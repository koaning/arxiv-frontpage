                  <p>Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis.Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning.However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment.This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding.Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling.At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information.To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points.Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies.To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation.Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Code is merged to a public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical scenarios.Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature.Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets.Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology.In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports.We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports.Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types.We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.</p>

                  <p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos.Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies.In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events.Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning.Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features.Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features.The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency.Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models.However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs.As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation.This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions.Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations.Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model.2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts.Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work.Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents IMAGGarment-1, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG) framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control over silhouette, color, and logo placement.Unlike existing methods that are limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment-1 addresses the challenges of multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital apparel applications.Specifically, IMAGGarment-1 employs a two-stage training strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference.In the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter.In the second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints, enabling accurate placement and visual consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support this task, we release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color references, logo placements, and textual prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance.The code and model are available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGGarment-1.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) excel at representing diverse raw modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, videos, etc.).As recommender systems increasingly incorporate these modalities, leveraging MFMs to generate better representations has great potential.However, their application in sequential recommendation remains largely unexplored.This is primarily because mainstream adaptation methods, such as Fine-Tuning and even Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter and LoRA), incur high computational costs, especially when integrating multiple modality encoders, thus hindering research progress.As a result, it remains unclear whether we can efficiently and effectively adapt multiple (>2) MFMs for the sequential recommendation task.   To address this, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN).Leveraging the fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm, CROSSAN achieves high efficiency while enabling cross-modal learning across diverse modalities.To optimize the final stage of multimodal fusion across diverse modalities, we adopt the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism.CROSSAN achieves superior performance on the public datasets for adapting four foundation models with raw modalities.Performance consistently improves as more MFMs are adapted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in video generation have posed great challenges in the assessment of AI-generated content, particularly with the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models.The various inconsistencies and defects observed in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring notoriously difficult.In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of integrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose $\textbf{F}$ing$\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation framework that first automatically generates $\textbf{F}$ine-grained $\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a $\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted summed to an overall score for different applications.Specifically, we leverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct perspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content, thereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more interpretable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately 3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with detailed reasons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span>Based on that, we further investigate various training protocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct answer prediction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start strategy achieves the best performance.Notably, our model surpasses existing methods by a relative margin of $11.8\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\%$ on MonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the training samples utilized by other methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.959</span></span></p>

By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles.To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples.Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset will be publicly available on our project page: https://joy-jy11.github.io/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span></p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models.Current machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data associations without degrading overall model capabilities.This paper presents our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with layer-specific optimization.Through systematic causal tracing experiments on OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute associations within MLP modules.Building on this insight, we develop a constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set deviation through adaptive regularization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves 2nd place in the 1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of baseline MMLU accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>These results establish causal-informed layer optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs, offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI systems.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis.Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning.However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment.This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding.Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling.At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information.To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points.Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies.To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html.Code is merged to a public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.</p>

                A Bad Example for Jain's Iterative Rounding Theorem for the Cover Small Cuts Problem

                  <p>Jain's iterative rounding theorem is a well-known result in the area of approximation algorithms and, more broadly, in combinatorial optimization.The theorem asserts that LP relaxations of several problems in network design and combinatorial optimization have the following key property: for every basic solution $x$ there exists a variable $x_e$ that has value at least a constant (e.g., $x_e\geq\frac12$).   We construct an example showing that this property fails to hold for the Cover Small Cuts problem.In this problem, we are given an undirected, capacitated graph $G=(V,E),u$ and a threshold value $\lambda$, as well as a set of links $L$ with end-nodes in $V$ and a non-negative cost for each link $\ell\in L$; the goal is to find a minimum-cost set of links such that each non-trivial cut of capacity less than $\lambda$ is covered by a link.   This indicates that the polyhedron of feasible solutions to the LP relaxation (of Cover Small Cuts) differs in an essential way from the polyhedrons associated with several problems in combinatorial optimization.Moreover, our example shows that a direct application of Jain's iterative rounding algorithm does not give an $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for Cover Small Cuts.We mention that Bansal et al.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(Algorithmica 2024) present an $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for Cover Small Cuts based on the primal-dual method of Williamson et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>(Combinatorica 1995).</p>

                  <p>Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for manipulation tasks.While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data.In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework.Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces.We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover.Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate and generalizable metric depth estimation is crucial for various computer vision applications but remains challenging due to the diverse depth scales encountered in indoor and outdoor environments.In this paper, we introduce Metric-Solver, a novel sliding anchor-based metric depth estimation method that dynamically adapts to varying scene scales.Our approach leverages an anchor-based representation, where a reference depth serves as an anchor to separate and normalize the scene depth into two components: scaled near-field depth and tapered far-field depth.The anchor acts as a normalization factor, enabling the near-field depth to be normalized within a consistent range while mapping far-field depth smoothly toward zero.Through this approach, any depth from zero to infinity in the scene can be represented within a unified representation, effectively eliminating the need to manually account for scene scale variations.More importantly, for the same scene, the anchor can slide along the depth axis, dynamically adjusting to different depth scales.A smaller anchor provides higher resolution in the near-field, improving depth precision for closer objects while a larger anchor improves depth estimation in far regions.This adaptability enables the model to handle depth predictions at varying distances and ensure strong generalization across datasets.Our design enables a unified and adaptive depth representation across diverse environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that Metric-Solver outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and cross-dataset generalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span></p>

To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and evaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design.HLS-Eval targets two core tasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2) performing HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS benchmarks and novel sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow that produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for C-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is "LLM-ready."   Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs.It includes a parallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for to support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of new benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.   We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on Vitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability, compilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS design cycle.We also report pass@k metrics, establishing clear baselines and reusable infrastructure for the broader LLM-for-hardware community.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All benchmarks, framework code, and results are open-sourced at https://github.com/stefanpie/hls-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data-driven genetic programming (GP) has proven highly effective in solving combinatorial optimization problems under dynamic and uncertain environments.A central challenge lies in fast fitness evaluations on large training datasets, especially for complex real-world problems involving time-consuming simulations.Surrogate models, like phenotypic characterization (PC)-based K-nearest neighbors (KNN), have been applied to reduce computational cost.However, the PC-based similarity measure is confined to behavioral characteristics, overlooking genotypic differences, which can limit surrogate quality and impair performance.To address these issues, this paper proposes a pheno-geno unified surrogate GP algorithm, PGU-SGP, integrating phenotypic and genotypic characterization (GC) to enhance surrogate sample selection and fitness prediction.A novel unified similarity metric combining PC and GC distances is proposed, along with an effective and efficient GC representation.Experimental results of a real-life vehicle scheduling problem demonstrate that PGU-SGP reduces training time by approximately 76% while achieving comparable performance to traditional GP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the same training time, PGU-SGP significantly outperforms traditional GP and the state-of-the-art algorithm on most datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Additionally, PGU-SGP shows faster convergence and improved surrogate quality by maintaining accurate fitness rankings and appropriate selection pressure, further validating its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>The necessity of abundant annotated data and complex network architectures presents a significant challenge in deep-learning Salient Object Detection (deep SOD) and across the broader deep-learning landscape.This challenge is particularly acute in medical applications in developing countries with limited computational resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Combining modern and classical techniques offers a path to maintaining competitive performance while enabling practical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) methodology empowers experts to design convolutional encoders through user-drawn markers, with filters learned directly from these annotations.Recent findings demonstrate that coupling a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder creates a flyweight network suitable for SOD, requiring significantly fewer parameters than lightweight models and eliminating the need for backpropagation.Cellular Automata (CA) methods have proven successful in data-scarce scenarios but require proper initialization -- typically through user input, priors, or randomness.We propose a practical intersection of these approaches: using FLIM networks to initialize CA states with expert knowledge without requiring user interaction for each image.By decoding features from each level of a FLIM network, we can initialize multiple CAs simultaneously, creating a multi-level framework.Our method leverages the hierarchical knowledge encoded across different network layers, merging multiple saliency maps into a high-quality final output that functions as a CA ensemble.Benchmarks across two challenging medical datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our multi-level CA approach compared to established models in the deep SOD literature.</p>

Given unique ranks, it is straightforward to select a designated leader.Thus, our protocol is a self-stabilizing leader election protocol as well.Ranking requires at least $n$ states per agent; hence, the goal is to minimize the additional number of states, called overhead states.The core of our protocol is a space-efficient but non-self-stabilizing ranking protocol that requires only $n + O(\log n)$ states.Our protocol stabilizes in $O(n^2\log n)$ interactions w.h.p.\ and in expectation, using $n + O(\log^2 n)$ states in total.Our stabilization time is asymptotically optimal (see Burman et al., PODC'21).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In comparison to the currently best known ranking protocol by Burman et al., which requires $n + \Omega(n)$ states, our result exponentially improves the number of overhead states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>The age of incorrect information (AoII) process which keeps track of the time since the source and monitor processes are in sync, has been extensively used in remote estimation problems.In this paper, we consider a push-based remote estimation system with a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) information source transmitting status update packets towards the monitor once the AoII process exceeds a certain estimation-based threshold.In this paper, the time average of an arbitrary function of AoII is taken as the AoII cost, as opposed to using the average AoII as the mismatch metric, whereas this function is also allowed to depend on the estimation value.In this very general setting, our goal is to minimize a weighted sum of AoII and transmission costs.For this purpose, we formulate a discrete-time semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) regarding the multi-threshold status update policy.We propose a novel tool in discrete-time called 'dual-regime absorbing Markov chain' (DR-AMC) and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as 'dual-regime phase-type' (DR-PH) distribution, to obtain the characterizing parameters of the SMDP, which allows us to obtain the distribution of the AoII process for a given policy, and hence the average of any function of AoII.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method is validated with numerical results by which we compare our proposed method against other policies obtained by exhaustive-search, and also various benchmark policies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency.However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: maintainability.To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose MaintainCoder as a pioneering solution.It integrates Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, and improve adaptability.We also introduce MaintainBench, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and corresponding dynamic metrics on maintainance effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In contrast, MaintainCoder improves maintainability metrics by 14-30% with even higher correctness, i.e. pass@k.Our work not only provides the foundation of maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more holistic code quality research.Resources: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder.</p>

                Enhancing Repository-Level Software Repair via Repository-Aware Knowledge Graphs

                  <p>Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge.Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL).However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system.During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location.Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers.The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments.To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions.It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis.Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning.However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment.This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding.Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling.At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information.To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points.Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies.To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation.Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Code is merged to a public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.</p>

                  <p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos.Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies.In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events.Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning.Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features.Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features.The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency.Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models.However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs.As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation.This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions.Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations.Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model.2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts.Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work.Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents IMAGGarment-1, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG) framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control over silhouette, color, and logo placement.Unlike existing methods that are limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment-1 addresses the challenges of multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital apparel applications.Specifically, IMAGGarment-1 employs a two-stage training strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference.In the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter.In the second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints, enabling accurate placement and visual consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support this task, we release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color references, logo placements, and textual prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance.The code and model are available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGGarment-1.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) excel at representing diverse raw modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, videos, etc.).As recommender systems increasingly incorporate these modalities, leveraging MFMs to generate better representations has great potential.However, their application in sequential recommendation remains largely unexplored.This is primarily because mainstream adaptation methods, such as Fine-Tuning and even Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter and LoRA), incur high computational costs, especially when integrating multiple modality encoders, thus hindering research progress.As a result, it remains unclear whether we can efficiently and effectively adapt multiple (>2) MFMs for the sequential recommendation task.   To address this, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN).Leveraging the fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm, CROSSAN achieves high efficiency while enabling cross-modal learning across diverse modalities.To optimize the final stage of multimodal fusion across diverse modalities, we adopt the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism.CROSSAN achieves superior performance on the public datasets for adapting four foundation models with raw modalities.Performance consistently improves as more MFMs are adapted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in video generation have posed great challenges in the assessment of AI-generated content, particularly with the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models.The various inconsistencies and defects observed in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring notoriously difficult.In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of integrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose $\textbf{F}$ing$\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation framework that first automatically generates $\textbf{F}$ine-grained $\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a $\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted summed to an overall score for different applications.Specifically, we leverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct perspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content, thereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more interpretable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately 3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with detailed reasons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span>Based on that, we further investigate various training protocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct answer prediction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start strategy achieves the best performance.Notably, our model surpasses existing methods by a relative margin of $11.8\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\%$ on MonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the training samples utilized by other methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.959</span></span></p>

By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles.To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples.Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset will be publicly available on our project page: https://joy-jy11.github.io/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent progress in diffusion models significantly advances various image generation tasks.However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs.While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design.To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation.Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations.Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Recent work shows that reinforcement learning(RL) can markedly sharpen the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by prompting them to "think before answering."Yet whether and how these gains transfer to audio-language reasoning remains largely unexplored.We extend the Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework from DeepSeek-R1 to a Large Audio-Language Model (LALM), and construct a 32k sample multiple-choice corpus.Using a two-stage regimen supervised fine-tuning on structured and unstructured chains-of-thought, followed by curriculum-guided GRPO, we systematically compare implicit vs. explicit, and structured vs. free form reasoning under identical architectures.Our structured audio reasoning model, SARI (Structured Audio Reasoning via Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning), achieves a 16.35% improvement in average accuracy over the base model Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the variant built upon Qwen2.5-Omni reaches state-of-the-art performance of 67.08% on the MMAU test-mini benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Ablation experiments show that on the base model we use: (i) SFT warm-up is important for stable RL training, (ii) structured chains yield more robust generalization than unstructured ones, and (iii) easy-to-hard curricula accelerate convergence and improve final performance.These findings demonstrate that explicit, structured reasoning and curriculum learning substantially enhances audio-language understanding.</p>

                  <p>In Android GUI testing, generating an action sequence for a task that can be replayed as a test script is common.Generating sequences of actions and respective test scripts from task goals described in natural language can eliminate the need for manually writing test scripts.However, existing approaches based on large language models (LLM) often struggle with identifying the final action, and either end prematurely or continue past the final screen.In this paper, we introduce VisiDroid, a multi-modal, LLM-based, multi-agent framework that iteratively determines the next action and leverages visual images of screens to detect the task's completeness.The multi-modal approach enhances our model in two significant ways.First, this approach enables it to avoid prematurely terminating a task when textual content alone provides misleading indications of task completion.Additionally, visual input helps the tool avoid errors when changes in the GUI do not directly affect functionality toward task completion, such as adjustments to font sizes or colors.Second, the multi-modal approach also ensures the tool not progress beyond the final screen, which might lack explicit textual indicators of task completion but could display a visual element indicating task completion, which is common in GUI apps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation shows that VisiDroid achieves an accuracy of 87.3%, outperforming the best baseline relatively by 23.5%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>We also demonstrate that our multi-modal framework with images and texts enables the LLM to better determine when a task is completed.</p>

                  <p>Multi-label requirements classification is a challenging task, especially when dealing with numerous classes at varying levels of abstraction.The difficulties increases when a limited number of requirements is available to train a supervised classifier.Zero-shot learning (ZSL) does not require training data and can potentially address this problem.This paper investigates the performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial dataset.We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed to support requirements tracing.We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using different embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number of parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large number of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama.Our ground truth includes 377 requirements and 1968 labels from 6 output spaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the evaluation, we adopt traditional metrics, i.e., precision, recall, F1, and $F_\beta$, as well as a novel label distance metric Dn. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>This aims to better capture the classification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of how far the results are from the ground truth.1)The top-performing model on 5 out of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04, while BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum $F_\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04.2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the best classification results compared to LLMs.Thus, addressing the problem in practice is feasible as limited computing power is needed.3) The model architecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence) significantly affects the classifier's performance.We conclude that using ZSL for multi-label requirements classification offers promising results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present a novel metric that can be used to select the top-performing model for this problem <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the continued growth of its core technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and data analytics, and edge computing, digital twin (DT) technology has witnessed a significant increase in industrial applications, helping the industry become more sustainable, smart, and adaptable.Hence, DT technology has emerged as a promising link between the physical and virtual worlds, enabling simulation, prediction, and real-time performance optimization.This work aims to explore the development of a high-fidelity digital twin framework, focusing on synchronization and accuracy between physical and digital systems to enhance data-driven decision making.To achieve this, we deploy several stationary UAVs in optimized locations to collect data from industrial IoT devices, which were used to monitor multiple physical entities and perform computations to evaluate their status.We consider a practical setup in which multiple IoT devices may monitor a single physical entity, and as a result, the measurements are combined and processed together to determine the status of the physical entity.The resulting status updates are subsequently uploaded from the UAVs to the base station, where the DT resides.In this work, we consider a novel metric based on the Age of Information (AoI), coined as the Age of Digital Twin (AoDT), to reflect the status freshness of the digital twin.Factoring AoDT in the problem formulation ensures that the DT reliably mirrors the physical system with high accuracy and synchronization.We formulate a mixed-integer non-convex program to maximize the total amount of data collected from all IoT devices while ensuring a constrained AoDT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using successive convex approximations, we solve the problem, conduct extensive simulations and compare the results with baseline approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes.They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems.Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding.In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance.Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations.In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles.While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases.We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement.Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution.We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts.Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class.Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent.Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Entity linking (EL) aligns textual mentions with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base, facilitating various applications such as semantic search and question answering.Recent advances in multimodal entity linking (MEL) have shown that combining text and images can reduce ambiguity and improve alignment accuracy.However, most existing MEL methods overlook the rich structural information available in the form of knowledge-graph (KG) triples.In this paper, we propose KGMEL, a novel framework that leverages KG triples to enhance MEL.Specifically, it operates in three stages: (1) Generation: Produces high-quality triples for each mention by employing vision-language models based on its text and images.(2) Retrieval:Learns joint mention-entity representations, via contrastive learning, that integrate text, images, and (generated or KG) triples to retrieve candidate entities for each mention.(3) Reranking: Refines the KG triples of the candidate entities and employs large language models to identify the best-matching entity for the mention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGMEL outperforms existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/juyeonnn/KGMEL.</p>

                  <p>This study introduces the Iterative Chainlet Partitioning (ICP) algorithm and its neural acceleration for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D).The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine.The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible.The number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability.Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tested over 1,059 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.75% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 79.8%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs.The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm.To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements.We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality.Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 49.7%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.12%.The framework's adaptability to various operational constraints makes it a valuable foundation for developing efficient algorithms for truck-drone synchronized routing problems.</p>

                  <p>Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents.While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence.To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes.Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views.Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency.Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses.These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness.We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://danielchyeh.github.io/All-Angles-Bench/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis.Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning.However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment.This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding.Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling.At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information.To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points.Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies.To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html.Code is merged to a public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR), aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and blurry inputs.Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in LR frames.To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR.To effectively fuse information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global scene context from the frames to enhance event features.Furthermore, to enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable alignment process.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and 7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/Ev-DeblurVSR.</p>

                A Bad Example for Jain's Iterative Rounding Theorem for the Cover Small Cuts Problem

                  <p>Jain's iterative rounding theorem is a well-known result in the area of approximation algorithms and, more broadly, in combinatorial optimization.The theorem asserts that LP relaxations of several problems in network design and combinatorial optimization have the following key property: for every basic solution $x$ there exists a variable $x_e$ that has value at least a constant (e.g., $x_e\geq\frac12$).   We construct an example showing that this property fails to hold for the Cover Small Cuts problem.In this problem, we are given an undirected, capacitated graph $G=(V,E),u$ and a threshold value $\lambda$, as well as a set of links $L$ with end-nodes in $V$ and a non-negative cost for each link $\ell\in L$; the goal is to find a minimum-cost set of links such that each non-trivial cut of capacity less than $\lambda$ is covered by a link.   This indicates that the polyhedron of feasible solutions to the LP relaxation (of Cover Small Cuts) differs in an essential way from the polyhedrons associated with several problems in combinatorial optimization.Moreover, our example shows that a direct application of Jain's iterative rounding algorithm does not give an $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for Cover Small Cuts.We mention that Bansal et al.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(Algorithmica 2024) present an $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for Cover Small Cuts based on the primal-dual method of Williamson et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>(Combinatorica 1995).</p>

                  <p>We introduce ViSMap: Unsupervised Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting, a system to summarise hour long videos with no-supervision.Most existing video understanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet they struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely distributed and not pre-segmented.Moreover, long-form video understanding often relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive annotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency.With ViSMaP we bridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and long ones (where it's not).We rely on LLMs to create optimised pseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones.These pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates long-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long videos.Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively generate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos.The strategy leverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model to guide the summary.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one to generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it, and a third to optimise the prompt of the generator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>This iteration is necessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on the generator prompt, and varies widely among videos.We evaluate our summaries extensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while generalising across domains without sacrificing performance.Code will be released upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Multi-label requirements classification is a challenging task, especially when dealing with numerous classes at varying levels of abstraction.The difficulties increases when a limited number of requirements is available to train a supervised classifier.Zero-shot learning (ZSL) does not require training data and can potentially address this problem.This paper investigates the performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial dataset.We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed to support requirements tracing.We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using different embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number of parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large number of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama.Our ground truth includes 377 requirements and 1968 labels from 6 output spaces.For the evaluation, we adopt traditional metrics, i.e., precision, recall, F1, and $F_\beta$, as well as a novel label distance metric Dn.This aims to better capture the classification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of how far the results are from the ground truth.1)The top-performing model on 5 out of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04, while BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum $F_\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the best classification results compared to LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Thus, addressing the problem in practice is feasible as limited computing power is needed.3) The model architecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence) significantly affects the classifier's performance.We conclude that using ZSL for multi-label requirements classification offers promising results.We also present a novel metric that can be used to select the top-performing model for this problem</p>

StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully unlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in existing disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage dependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length distributions.To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional stage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and achieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL.To address skewness bubbles, StreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples and reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling.Experiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to existing state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to 1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.</p>

                  <p>The security of smart contracts is critical in blockchain systems, where even minor vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses.Researchers proposed several vulnerability detection tools evaluated using existing benchmarks.However, most benchmarks are outdated and focus on a narrow set of vulnerabilities.This work evaluates whether mutation seeding can effectively inject vulnerabilities into Solidity-based smart contracts and whether state-of-the-art static analysis tools can detect the injected flaws.We aim to automatically inject vulnerabilities into smart contracts to generate large and wide benchmarks.We propose MuSe, a tool to generate vulnerable smart contracts by leveraging pattern-based mutation operators to inject six vulnerability types into real-world smart contracts.We analyzed these vulnerable smart contracts using Slither, a static analysis tool, to determine its capacity to identify them and assess their validity.The results show that each vulnerability has a different injection rate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Not all smart contracts can exhibit some vulnerabilities because they lack the prerequisites for injection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Furthermore, static analysis tools fail to detect all vulnerabilities injected using pattern-based mutations, underscoring the need for enhancements in static analyzers and demonstrating that benchmarks generated by mutation seeding tools can improve the evaluation of detection tools.</p>

                The Myth of Immutability: A Multivocal Review on Smart Contract Upgradeability

                  <p>The immutability of smart contracts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum promotes security and trustworthiness but presents challenges for updates, bug fixes, or adding new features post-deployment.These limitations can lead to vulnerabilities and outdated functionality, impeding the evolution and maintenance of decentralized applications.Despite various upgrade mechanisms proposed in academic research and industry, a comprehensive analysis of their trade-offs and practical implications is lacking.This study aims to systematically identify, classify, and evaluate existing smart contract upgrade mechanisms, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementations.It introduces standardized terminology and evaluates the trade-offs of different approaches using software quality attributes.We conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) to analyze upgrade mechanisms from both academic research and industry practice.We first establish a unified definition of smart contract upgradeability and identify core components essential for understanding the upgrade process.Based on this definition, we classify existing methods into full upgrade and partial upgrade approaches, introducing standardized terminology to harmonize the diverse terms used in the literature.We then characterize each approach and assess its benefits and limitations using software quality attributes such as complexity, flexibility, security, and usability.The analysis highlights significant trade-offs among upgrade mechanisms, providing valuable insights into the benefits and limitations of each approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings guide developers and researchers in selecting mechanisms tailored to specific project requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or interpretable reasoning steps.This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases.To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models.Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models.We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors.We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and reasoning traces will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction.However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity.To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation.RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation.To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies.This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences.We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities.Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability.Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span></p>

We highlight for developers that code generated by ChatGPT is more likely to contain vulnerabilities compared to their own code.Furthermore, at times ChatGPT reports incorrect information with apparent confidence, which may mislead less experienced developers.Our findings confirm previous studies in demonstrating that ChatGPT is not sufficiently reliable for generating secure code nor identifying all vulnerabilities, highlighting the continuing importance of static scanners and manual review.</p>

                  <p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs).While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs.The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities.To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training.By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores.Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recovering 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) from single color images is challenging due to depth ambiguities, occlusions, and the huge variation in object shape and appearance.Thus, past work requires controlled settings such as known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.Instead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset of natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object meshes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are paired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D body.In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object.To infer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a database by leveraging vision foundation models.Then, we project DAMON's body contact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per patch.This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences between bodies and objects.(2) We exploit our new dataset of contact correspondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit, to recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction.PICO-fit infers contact for the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db for that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object meshes to image evidence via optimization.Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for many object categories that no existing method can tackle.This is crucial to enable HOI understanding to scale in the wild.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and code are available at https://pico.is.tue.mpg.de. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.915</span></span></p>

                  <p>Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced "Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to understand human activities in real-world settings.DARai consists of continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10 different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors, biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.   To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks, (ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and (iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.   Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels.To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/software-and-datasets/darai-daily-activity-recordings-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>Flaky tests produce inconsistent outcomes without code changes, creating major challenges for software developers.An industrial case study reported that developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly cost of $2,250.We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with co-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic flakiness.This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing shared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather than tackling them individually.This study represents an inflection point by challenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated occurrences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24 Java projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job scheduling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>It contains 810 flaky tests, which we levered to perform a mixed-method empirical analysis of co-occurring flaky test failures.Systemic flakiness is significant and widespread.We performed agglomerative clustering of flaky tests based on their failure co-occurrence, finding that 75% of flaky tests across all projects belong to a cluster, with a mean cluster size of 13.5 flaky tests.Instead of requiring 10,000 test suite runs to identify systemic flakiness, we demonstrated a lightweight alternative by training machine learning models based on static test case distance measures.Through manual inspection of stack traces, conducted independently by four authors and resolved through negotiated agreement, we identified intermittent networking issues and instabilities in external dependencies as the predominant causes of systemic flakiness.</p>

                  <p>Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge.Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL).However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system.During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location.Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers.The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments.To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions.It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged.As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate.They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses.To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations.xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions.To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales.In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%.Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance.These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.</p>

                  <p>In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can significantly impact outcomes.Objects that are heavily occluded or intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human observation or through advanced technological applications.While certain Deep Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in handling distant information, e.g., transformers.In X-ray security imaging the literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been sufficiently explored.In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline, namely YOLOv8.In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer (Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR).The resulting architectures are comparatively evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS, HiXray, and PIDray.Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer architectures exhibit increased robustness.Detailed comparative evaluation results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural combination and suggest guidelines for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and network weights of the models employed in this study are available at https://github.com/jgenc/xray-comparative-evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series.However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values.The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights.To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling.Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, long-thought reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but often incur substantial inference overhead, making efficiency a critical concern.Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit of using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate reasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy.This motivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the input.However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning paths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT paradigm.To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive and efficient reasoning.First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by merging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles.Second, we apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable reasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within each style group (instance-level).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline approaches, while maintaining performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Notably, on five mathematical datasets, the average length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%, highlighting the potential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning efficiency in large language models.Our code is coming soon at https://github.com/StarDewXXX/AdaR1</p>

                  <p>Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful tool to efficiently solve computational challenges, particularly in simulation and optimisation.However, hardware limitations prevent quantum computers from achieving the full theoretical potential.Among the quantum algorithms, quantum annealing is a prime candidate to solve optimisation problems.This makes it a natural candidate for search-based software testing in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) domain, which demands effective test cases due to their safety-critical nature.This work explores the use of quantum annealing to enhance test case generation for CPS through a mutation-based approach.We encode test case mutation as a binary optimisation problem, and use quantum annealing to identify and target critical regions of the test cases for improvement.Our approach mechanises this process into an algorithm that uses D-Wave's quantum annealer to find the solution.As a main contribution, we offer insights into how quantum annealing can advance software testing methodologies by empirically evaluating the correlation between problem size, hardware limitations, and the effectiveness of the results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we compare the proposed method against state-of-the-art classical optimisation algorithms, targeting efficiency (time to generate test cases) and effectiveness (fault detection rates). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Results indicate that quantum annealing enables faster test case generation while achieving comparable fault detection performance to state-of-the-art alternatives.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model.The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications.Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques.In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks.In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance.To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB.Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models.After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction.In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples.To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</p>

                  <p>Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines.In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network framework, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset.Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively.Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures.Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in addressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks.However, recent studies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial attacks.Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real world, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks and enhance the robustness of GNNs.Despite the commendable performance of these defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural bias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail nodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes with low degree in the clean graph.Therefore, in this work, we propose a defense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN augmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to mitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks.Notably, the hetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low degree.To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is adopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of graph views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and debiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Salient Object Detection (SOD) methods can locate objects that stand out in an image, assign higher values to their pixels in a saliency map, and binarize the map outputting a predicted segmentation mask.A recent tendency is to investigate pre-trained lightweight models rather than deep neural networks in SOD tasks, coping with applications under limited computational resources.In this context, we have investigated lightweight networks using a methodology named Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), which assumes that the encoder's kernels can be estimated from marker pixels on discriminative regions of a few representative images.This work proposes flyweight networks, hundreds of times lighter than lightweight models, for SOD by combining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, whose weights are estimated for each input image by a given heuristic function.Such FLIM networks are trained from three to four representative images only and without backpropagation, making the models suitable for applications under labeled data constraints as well.We study five adaptive decoders; two of them are introduced here.Differently from the previous ones that rely on one neuron per pixel with shared weights, the heuristic functions of the new adaptive decoders estimate the weights of each neuron per pixel.We compare FLIM models with adaptive decoders for two challenging SOD tasks with three lightweight networks from the state-of-the-art, two FLIM networks with decoders trained by backpropagation, and one FLIM network whose labeled markers define the decoder's weights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed networks over the baselines, revealing the importance of further investigating such methods in new applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills.For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently.DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them.However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them.In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects.This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity.The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it.To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS.Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs.RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.</p>

                  <p>We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system kernel verification tasks.The benchmark first defines the specification generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model.The LLMs are required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete specification for the potentially buggy operating system code implementation under the guidance of the high-level functional description of the operating system.This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each is a long context task of about 20k-30k tokens.Our comprehensive evaluation of 12 LLMs exhibits the limited performance of the current LLMs on the specification generation tasks for operating system verification.Significant disparities in their performance on the benchmark highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation toolkit and benchmark are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

We extend this implementation to an \emph{auditable max register} that tracks the largest value ever written.The implementation deals with the additional challenge posed by the max register semantics, which allows readers to learn prior values without reading them.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The max register, in turn, serves as the foundation for implementing an \emph{auditable snapshot} object and, more generally, \emph{versioned types}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>These extensions maintain the strengthened notion of auditability, appropriately adapted from multi-writer, multi-reader registers.</p>

                  <p>The development of powerful user representations is a key factor in the success of recommender systems (RecSys).Online platforms employ a range of RecSys techniques to personalize user experience across diverse in-app surfaces.User representations are often learned individually through user's historical interactions within each surface and user representations across different surfaces can be shared post-hoc as auxiliary features or additional retrieval sources.While effective, such schemes cannot directly encode collaborative filtering signals across different surfaces, hindering its capacity to discover complex relationships between user behaviors and preferences across the whole platform.To bridge this gap at Snapchat, we seek to conduct universal user modeling (UUM) across different in-app surfaces, learning general-purpose user representations which encode behaviors across surfaces.Instead of replacing domain-specific representations, UUM representations capture cross-domain trends, enriching existing representations with complementary information.This work discusses our efforts in developing initial UUM versions, practical challenges, technical choices and modeling and research directions with promising offline performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Following successful A/B testing, UUM representations have been launched in production, powering multiple use cases and demonstrating their value. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>UUM embedding has been incorporated into (i) Long-form Video embedding-based retrieval, leading to 2.78% increase in Long-form Video Open Rate, (ii) Long-form Video L2 ranking, with 19.2% increase in Long-form Video View Time sum, (iii) Lens L2 ranking, leading to 1.76% increase in Lens play time, and (iv) Notification L2 ranking, with 0.87% increase in Notification Open Rate.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

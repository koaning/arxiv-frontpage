                  <p>Malocclusion is a major challenge in orthodontics, and its complex presentation and diverse clinical manifestations make accurate localization and diagnosis particularly important.Currently, one of the major shortcomings facing the field of dental image analysis is the lack of large-scale, accurately labeled datasets dedicated to malocclusion issues, which limits the development of automated diagnostics in the field of dentistry and leads to a lack of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice.Therefore, in this study, we propose the Oral and Maxillofacial Natural Images (OMNI) dataset, a novel and comprehensive dental image dataset aimed at advancing the study of analyzing dental images for issues of malocclusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the dataset contains 4166 multi-view images with 384 participants in data collection and annotated by professional dentists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>In addition, we performed a comprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based methods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted automated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues.The experimental results show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis research of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in this field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our OMNI dataset and baseline code are publicly available at https://github.com/RoundFaceJ/OMNI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations.However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3) No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models and a wide variety of edited objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image classification and edited region localization.Experimental results show that fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets, significantly outperforming pretrained models.We further conduct ablation and transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various configurations and editing scenarios.To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field.We anticipate that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we describe a new type of match between a pattern and a text that aren't necessarily maximal in the query, but still contain useful matching information: locally maximal exact matches (LEMs).There are usually a large amount of LEMs, so we only consider those above some length threshold $\mathcal{L}$. These are referred to as long LEMs.The purpose of long LEMs is to capture substring matches between a query and a text that are not necessarily maximal in the pattern but still long enough to be important.Therefore efficient long LEMs finding algorithms are desired for these datasets.However, these datasets are too large to query on traditional string indexes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Fortunately, these datasets are very repetitive. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Recently, compressed string indexes that take advantage of the redundancy in the data but retain efficient querying capability have been proposed as a solution.We therefore give an efficient algorithm for computing all the long LEMs of a query and a text in a BWT runs compressed string index.We describe an $O(m+occ)$ expected time algorithm that relies on an $O(r)$ words space string index for outputting all long LEMs of a pattern with respect to a text given the matching statistics of the pattern with respect to the text.Here $m$ is the length of the query, $occ$ is the number of long LEMs outputted, and $r$ is the number of runs in the BWT of the text.The $O(r)$ space string index we describe relies on an adaptation of the move data structure by Nishimoto and Tabei.We are able to support $LCP[i]$ queries in constant time given $SA[i]$. In other words, we answer $PLCP[i]$ queries in constant time.Long LEMs may provide useful similarity information between a pattern and a text that MEMs may ignore.This information is particularly useful in pangenome and biobank scale haplotype panel contexts.</p>

                  <p>Current medical retrieval benchmarks primarily emphasize lexical or shallow semantic similarity, overlooking the reasoning-intensive demands that are central to clinical decision-making.In practice, physicians often retrieve authoritative medical evidence to support diagnostic hypotheses.Such evidence typically aligns with an inferred diagnosis rather than the surface form of a patient's symptoms, leading to low lexical or semantic overlap between queries and relevant documents.To address this gap, we introduce R2MED, the first benchmark explicitly designed for reasoning-driven medical retrieval.It comprises 876 queries spanning three tasks: Q&A reference retrieval, clinical evidence retrieval, and clinical case retrieval.These tasks are drawn from five representative medical scenarios and twelve body systems, capturing the complexity and diversity of real-world medical information needs.We evaluate 15 widely-used retrieval systems on R2MED and find that even the best model achieves only 31.4 nDCG@10, demonstrating the benchmark's difficulty.Classical re-ranking and generation-augmented retrieval methods offer only modest improvements.Although large reasoning models improve performance via intermediate inference generation, the best results still peak at 41.4 nDCG@10.These findings underscore a substantial gap between current retrieval techniques and the reasoning demands of real clinical tasks.We release R2MED as a challenging benchmark to foster the development of next-generation medical retrieval systems with enhanced reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at https://github.com/R2MED/R2MED <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Falsely annotated samples, also known as noisy labels, can significantly harm the performance of deep learning models.Two main approaches for learning with noisy labels are global noise estimation and data filtering.Global noise estimation approximates the noise across the entire dataset using a noise transition matrix, but it can unnecessarily adjust correct labels, leaving room for local improvements.Data filtering, on the other hand, discards potentially noisy samples but risks losing valuable data.Our method identifies potentially noisy samples based on their loss distribution.We then apply a selection process to separate noisy and clean samples and learn a noise transition matrix to correct the loss for noisy samples while leaving the clean data unaffected, thereby improving the training process.Our approach ensures robust learning and enhanced model performance by preserving valuable information from noisy samples and refining the correction process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We applied our method to standard image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) and a biological scRNA-seq cell-type annotation dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>We observed a significant improvement in model accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.</p>

                  <p>Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) plays a crucial role in visual affective computing, aiming to infer a person's emotional state based on facial data.Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs) that provide detailed emotional insights.However, traditional methods often struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and reasoning abilities.Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various visual tasks, while they still face significant challenges in FEA due to the lack of specialized datasets and their inability to capture the intricate relationships between FEs and AUs.To address these issues, we introduce a novel FEA Instruction Dataset that provides accurate and aligned FE and AU descriptions and establishes causal reasoning relationships between them, followed by constructing a new benchmark, FEABench.Moreover, we propose FEALLM, a novel MLLM architecture designed to capture more detailed facial information, enhancing its capability in FEA tasks.Our model demonstrates strong performance on FEABench and impressive generalization capability through zero-shot evaluation on various datasets, including RAF-DB, AffectNet, BP4D, and DISFA, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in FEA tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/953206211/FEALLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) task.First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited.It poses the challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning.Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings.It leads to ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for annotating such signs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>It is shown that a model, pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning.We explore cross-language transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the most.The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually similar sign groups.We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks.Based on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a single stream model processing solely RGB video.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure.Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics.Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors.In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities.In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models.By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner.The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project page is https://customsvg.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks.Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results.Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks.However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task.To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas.Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge.We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning navigation in dynamic open-world environments is an important yet challenging skill for robots.Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations.In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments.The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer.Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20$\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments.In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap.Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\% without hurting its generalization capability.</p>

                  <p>Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering.The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment:The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks.Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications.Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability.We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.</p>

                  <p>We study the problem of finding a maximal independent set (MIS) in the standard LOCAL model of distributed computing.Classical algorithms by Luby [JACM'86] and Alon, Babai, and Itai [JALG'86] find an MIS in $O(\log n)$ rounds in $n$-node graphs with high probability.Despite decades of research, the existence of any $o(\log n)$-round algorithm for general graphs remains one of the major open problems in the field.   Interestingly, the hard instances for this problem must contain constant-length cycles.This is because there exists a sublogarithmic-round algorithm for graphs with super-constant girth; i.e., graphs where the length of the shortest cycle is $\omega(1)$, as shown by Ghaffari~[SODA'16].Thus, resolving this $\approx 40$-year-old open problem requires understanding the family of graphs that contain $k$-cycles for some constant $k$.   In this work, we come very close to resolving this $\approx 40$-year-old open problem by presenting a sublogarithmic-round algorithm for graphs that can contain $k$-cycles for all $k >6$.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our algorithm finds an MIS in $O\left(\frac{\log \Delta}{\log(\log^* \Delta)} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>+ \mathrm{poly}(\log\log n)\right)$ rounds, as long as the graph does not contain cycles of length $\leq 6$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph.As a result, we push the limit on the girth of graphs that admit sublogarithmic-round algorithms from $k = \omega(1)$ all the way down to a small constant $k=7$. This also implies a $o(\sqrt{\log n})$ round algorithm for MIS in trees, refuting a conjecture from the book by Barrenboim and Elkin.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have renewed focus on the design of reward functions that shape agent behavior.Manually designing reward functions is tedious and error-prone.A principled alternative is to specify behaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into rewards.Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given their established role in formal verification and synthesis.However, existing methods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward RL in episodic settings, with periodic resets.This setup misaligns with the semantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over infinite behavior traces.In such cases, the average reward criterion and the continuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a single, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.   To address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on absolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that cannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to the continuing setting.We present the first model-free RL framework that translates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives.Our approach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting.We also introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective optimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the policies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given omega-regular specification.Our method guarantees convergence in unknown communicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full knowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show our average-reward approach in continuing setting outperforms discount-based methods across benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising performance in solving complex tasks.LRMs solve tasks that require complex reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with answers.Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well.Logically, if the soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the confidence of the derived answer should be low.Existing methods did consider jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly reflected.In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation.Specifically, our CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process, which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field.Our CoT-Kinetics energy assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework, such as $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$. After over a decade of $\sf Adam$'s dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements, offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency, better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training.However, a significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes.To address both, we propose a new LMO-based method called $\sf Gluon$, capturing prior theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical predictive power.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al.

                  <p>Tabular data, a fundamental data format in machine learning, is predominantly utilized in competitions and real-world applications.The performance of tabular models--such as gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks--can vary significantly across datasets due to differences in feature distributions and task characteristics.Achieving top performance on each dataset often requires specialized expert knowledge.To address this variability, practitioners often aggregate the predictions of multiple models.However, conventional aggregation strategies typically rely on static combination rules and lack instance-level adaptability.In this work, we propose an in-context ensemble framework for tabular prediction that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform dynamic, instance-specific integration of external model predictions.Without access to raw tabular features or semantic information, our method constructs a context around each test instance using its nearest neighbors and the predictions from a pool of external models.Within this enriched context, we introduce Chain of Tabular Thoughts (CoT$^2$), a prompting strategy that guides LLMs through multi-step, interpretable reasoning, making still further progress toward expert-level decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our method outperforms well-tuned baselines and standard ensemble techniques across a wide range of tabular datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant processing, driving interest in context compression techniques.Existing methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or encode context into latent representations for soft global compression.However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the loss of potentially valuable information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose $\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details for task completion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks.Then we incorporate a classification layer that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded.To foster a balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning.This promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing local and global information retention in context compression.Experiments show that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while reducing token usage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It improves the performance of various LLM series by an average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Moreover, HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token consumption by 88.8\%.</p>

                  <p>Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation.However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before.Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation.Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding.Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent.We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval.Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis.Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

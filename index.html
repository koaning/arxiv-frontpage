                  <p>Current diffusion-based text-to-video methods are limited to producing short video clips of a single shot and lack the capability to generate multi-shot videos with discrete transitions where the same character performs distinct activities across the same or different backgrounds.To address this limitation we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot video generation.Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number, duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning.This is achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control, outperforming the baselines.You can find more details in https://shotadapter.github.io/</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in software development has introduced new ways for developers to interact with AI, particularly in pull request workflows.While prior research has examined AI-generated code quality, there is limited understanding of how ChatGPT is utilized in real-world pull request decision-making and how its suggestions influence patch integration and rejection.To explore these aspects, we analyze self-admitted ChatGPT usage (SACU), where developers explicitly disclose their reliance on ChatGPT within pull request discussions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study examines 338 pull requests (285 merged, 53 closed) across 255 GitHub repositories, containing 645 ChatGPT-generated code snippets and 3,486 patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>We introduce PatchTrack, a classification tool that determines whether ChatGPT-generated patches were applied (PA, 115 cases), not applied (PN, 64 cases), or not suggested (NE, 106 cases).Our findings reveal that full adoption of ChatGPT-generated code is rare, developers frequently modify or selectively integrate AI-generated patches to align with project constraints, with a median integration rate of 25%.Through qualitative analysis, we identify key factors influencing patch integration and pull request rejection, including scope misalignment, maintainability concerns, redundant solutions, and procedural barriers such as incomplete documentation or administrative policies.By providing empirical insights into ChatGPT's role in pull request workflows, this study informs developers, maintainers, and educators on the evolving use of generative AI in collaborative software development.It also lays the groundwork for future research on optimizing AI-assisted development, improving transparency in AI adoption, and enhancing patch integration workflows.</p>

                  <p>Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next preferences based on their interaction histories, but existing approaches face critical limitations in efficiency and multi-scale pattern recognition.While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features.To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating.First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise.Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions.Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion.Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines.Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M2Rec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>The visually impaired population, especially the severely visually impaired, is currently large in scale, and daily activities pose significant challenges for them.Although many studies use large language and vision-language models to assist the blind, most focus on static content and fail to meet real-time perception needs in dynamic and complex environments, such as daily activities.To provide them with more effective intelligent assistance, it is imperative to incorporate advanced visual understanding technologies.Although real-time vision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual understanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness in assisting visually impaired individuals.In this work, we conduct the first such evaluation.First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily), covering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals: Basic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks.The results show that GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate.Next, we conduct a user study to evaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further exploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts.One key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving potential hazards in dynamic environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we build an environment-awareness dataset named SafeVid and introduce a polling mechanism that enables the model to proactively detect environmental risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.</p>

                  <p>Gait recognition has emerged as a powerful tool for unobtrusive and long-range identity analysis, with growing relevance in surveillance and monitoring applications.Although recent advances in deep learning and large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate recognition under closed-set conditions, real-world deployment demands open-set gait enrollment, which means determining whether a new gait sample corresponds to a known identity or represents a previously unseen individual.In this work, we introduce a transformer-based framework for open-set gait enrollment that is both dataset-agnostic and recognition-architecture-agnostic.Our method leverages a SetTransformer to make enrollment decisions based on the embedding of a probe sample and a context set drawn from the gallery, without requiring task-specific thresholds or retraining for new environments.By decoupling enrollment from the main recognition pipeline, our model is generalized across different datasets, gallery sizes, and identity distributions.We propose an evaluation protocol that uses existing datasets in different ratios of identities and walks per identity.We instantiate our method using skeleton-based gait representations and evaluate it on two benchmark datasets (CASIA-B and PsyMo), using embeddings from three state-of-the-art recognition models (GaitGraph, GaitFormer, and GaitPT).We show that our method is flexible, is able to accurately perform enrollment in different scenarios, and scales better with data compared to traditional approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make the code and dataset scenarios publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction.However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity.To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation.RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation.To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies.This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences.We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities.Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability.Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span></p>

                  <p>Black-box scanners have played a significant role in detecting vulnerabilities for web applications.A key focus in current black-box scanning is increasing test coverage (i.e., accessing more web pages).However, since many web applications are user-oriented, some deep pages can only be accessed through complex user interactions, which are difficult to reach by existing black-box scanners.To fill this gap, a key insight is that web pages contain a wealth of semantic information that can aid in understanding potential user intention.Based on this insight, we propose Hoyen, a black-box scanner that uses the Large Language Model to predict user intention and provide guidance for expanding the scanning scope.Hoyen has been rigorously evaluated on 12 popular open-source web applications and compared with 6 representative tools.The results demonstrate that Hoyen performs a comprehensive exploration of web applications, expanding the attack surface while achieving about 2x than the coverage of other scanners on average, with high request accuracy.Furthermore, Hoyen detected over 90% of its requests towards the core functionality of the application, detecting more vulnerabilities than other scanners, including unique vulnerabilities in well-known web applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data/code is available at https://hoyen.tjunsl.com/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs).While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs.The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities.To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training.By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores.Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semi-supervised learning has become a compelling approach for 3D tooth segmentation from CBCT scans, where labeled data is minimal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing methods still face two persistent challenges: limited corrective supervision in structurally ambiguous or mislabeled regions during supervised training and performance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>To address these problems, we propose Region-Aware Instructive Learning (RAIL), a dual-group dual-student, semi-supervised framework.Each group contains two student models guided by a shared teacher network.By alternating training between the two groups, RAIL promotes intergroup knowledge transfer and collaborative region-aware instruction while reducing overfitting to the characteristics of any single model.Specifically, RAIL introduces two instructive mechanisms.Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller improves supervised learning by instructing predictions only within areas where student outputs diverge from both ground truth and the best student, thereby concentrating supervision on structurally ambiguous or mislabeled areas.In the unsupervised phase, Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator reinforces agreement in regions with high model certainty while reducing the effect of low-confidence predictions during training.This helps prevent our model from learning unstable patterns and improves the overall reliability of pseudo-labels.Extensive experiments on four CBCT tooth segmentation datasets show that RAIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods under limited annotation.Our code will be available at https://github.com/Tournesol-Saturday/RAIL.</p>

                  <p>Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, characterized by persistently high blood sugar levels, capable of damaging various internal organs and systems.Diabetes patients require routine check-ups, resulting in a time series of laboratory records, such as hemoglobin A1c, which reflects each patient's health behavior over time and informs their doctor's recommendations.Clustering patients into groups based on their entire time series data assists doctors in making recommendations and choosing treatments without the need to review all records.However, time series clustering of this type of dataset introduces some challenges; patients visit their doctors at different time points, making it difficult to capture and match trends, peaks, and patterns.Additionally, two aspects must be considered: differences in the levels of laboratory results and differences in trends and patterns.To address these challenges, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Time and Trend Traveling Time Series Clustering (4TaStiC), using a base dissimilarity measure combined with Euclidean and Pearson correlation metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated this algorithm on artificial datasets, comparing its performance with that of seven existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>The results show that 4TaStiC outperformed the other methods on the targeted datasets.Finally, we applied 4TaStiC to cluster a cohort of 1,989 type 2 diabetes patients at Siriraj Hospital.Each group of patients exhibits clear characteristics that will benefit doctors in making efficient clinical decisions.Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to contexts outside the medical field.</p>

                  <p>WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization schemes deliver highly accurate location data by matching the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) with an offline database using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) models.However, over time, RSSI values degrade due to the malicious behavior of access points (APs), causing low positional accuracy due to RSSI value mismatch with the offline database.Existing literature lacks detection of malicious APs in the online phase and mitigating their effects.This research addresses these limitations and proposes a long-term reliable indoor localization scheme by incorporating malicious AP detection and their effect mitigation techniques.The proposed scheme uses a Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) classifier to estimate locations and integrates simple yet efficient techniques to detect malicious APs based on online query data.Subsequently, a mitigation technique is incorporated that updates the offline database and online queries by imputing stable values for malicious APs using LGBM Regressors.Additionally, we introduce a noise addition mechanism in the offline database to capture the dynamic environmental effects.Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed scheme attains a detection accuracy above 95% for each attack type.The mitigation strategy effectively restores the system's performance nearly to its original state when no malicious AP is present.The noise addition module reduces localization errors by nearly 16%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the proposed solution is lightweight, reducing the execution time by approximately 94% compared to the existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Temporal interaction graphs (TIGs), defined by sequences of timestamped interaction events, have become ubiquitous in real-world applications due to their capability to model complex dynamic system behaviors.As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years.TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments.In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies.We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising research directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements that have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.</p>

                  <p>Accurate state estimation is essential for effective control of robots.For soft robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states are inherently infinite-dimensional functions due to the robots' continuous deformability.Traditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide discrete measurements.Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a boundary observer was introduced, which leverages Cosserat rod theory to recover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the velocity twist at the robot's tip.In this work, we present a novel boundary observer that can also recover infinite-dimensional dynamic states, but instead relies on measuring the internal wrench at the robot's base.This design exploits the duality between the velocity twist at the tip and the internal wrench at the base, with both types of boundary observers being inspired by principles of energy dissipation.Despite the mathematical duality, the proposed approach offers a distinct advantage: it requires only a 6-axis force/torque sensor embedded at the base, eliminating the need for external sensing systems such as motion capture cameras.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, combining both tip- and base-based techniques enhances energy dissipation, accelerates convergence, and improves estimation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>We validate the proposed algorithms through both simulation studies and experiments based on tendon-driven continuum robots.Our results demonstrate that all boundary observers converge to the ground truth within 3 seconds, even with significantly deviated initial conditions.Furthermore, they recover from unknown perturbations and effectively track high-frequency vibrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that combining the dual techniques further improves convergence speed and accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Finally, the computational efficiency of these algorithms indicates their feasibility for real-time state estimation.</p>

                  <p>The GitHub issue resolution task aims to resolve issues reported in repositories automatically.With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs.However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues.Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues.In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain.OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains.Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL.Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues.Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images.The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information.Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation.However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before.Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation.Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding.Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent.We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval.Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis.Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

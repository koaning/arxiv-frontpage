                  <p>Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) remains a challenging task in the field of music information retrieval, despite great advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) brought about by transformer-based architectures in recent years.One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering audio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment.Recent advances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of high-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.However, the effect of source separation has not been systematically investigated in order to establish best practices for its use.This work examines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a state-of-the-art open source ASR model.We evaluate Whisper's performance on original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and long-form transcription tasks.For short-form, we suggest a concatenation method that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER).For long-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity detector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction in WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT benchmark, without any training or fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also publish MUSDB-ALT, the first dataset of long-form lyric transcripts following the Jam-ALT guidelines for which vocal stems are publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping.Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets.While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs.We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead.Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4.It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both.This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge.We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning.To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces.Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence.Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present Ring-lite, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language model optimized via reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and robust reasoning capabilities.Built upon the publicly available Ling-lite model, a 16.8 billion parameter model with 2.75 billion activated parameters, our approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-scale reasoning models on challenging benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) while activating only one-third of the parameters required by comparable models.To accomplish this, we introduce a joint training pipeline integrating distillation with RL, revealing undocumented challenges in MoE RL training.First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology.Second, we empirically demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training.Finally, we develop a two-stage training paradigm to harmonize multi-domain data integration, addressing domain conflicts that arise in training with mixed dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the model, dataset, and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices.However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications.This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive.UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps.It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05.Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges.Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks.AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks.AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>The explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has revolutionized digital ownership by enabling the creation, exchange, and monetization of unique assets on blockchain networks.However, this surge in popularity has also given rise to a disturbing trend: the emergence of rug pulls - fraudulent schemes where developers exploit trust and smart contract privileges to drain user funds or invalidate asset ownership.Central to many of these scams are hidden backdoors embedded within NFT smart contracts.Unlike unintentional bugs, these backdoors are deliberately coded and often obfuscated to bypass traditional audits and exploit investor confidence.In this paper, we present a large-scale static analysis of 49,940 verified NFT smart contracts using Slither, a static analysis framework, to uncover latent vulnerabilities commonly linked to rug pulls.We introduce a custom risk scoring model that classifies contracts into high, medium, or low risk tiers based on the presence and severity of rug pull indicators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset was derived from verified contracts on the Ethereum mainnet, and we generate multiple visualizations to highlight red flag clusters, issue prevalence, and co-occurrence of critical vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>While we do not perform live exploits, our results reveal how malicious patterns often missed by simple reviews can be surfaced through static analysis at scale.We conclude by offering mitigation strategies for developers, marketplaces, and auditors to enhance smart contract security.By exposing how hidden backdoors manifest in real-world smart contracts, this work contributes a practical foundation for detecting and mitigating NFT rug pulls through scalable automated analysis.</p>

                  <p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object.Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging.To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references.We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image.For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model.Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions.This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.Project page: https://minfenli.github.io/UA-Pose/</p>

                  <p>In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a vital research direction in robotics due to their impressive multimodal understanding and generalization capabilities.Despite the progress, their practical deployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly in high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks.While recent studies have explored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional autoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy iterations.To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to predict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving acceleration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error accumulation during distillation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Although distillation brings acceptable speedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical bottleneck.To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that moderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average inference efficiency.Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines while maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world robot tasks.These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient and general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics.Our project page is available at https://irpn-eai.github.io/CEED-VLA/.</p>

                  <p>Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$).However, the likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta (y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training, inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses.In this paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs, showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video content.To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to the policy model.A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the preference data via self-reflection.This allows the policy model to obtain high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus mitigating the unintended drop.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce a dynamic label smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead.Moreover, LeanPO offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient Video-LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings.Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \textit{``hello''}).Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser.We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design.Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an arbitrary cutoff point.As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff.Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers.Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.</p>

                  <p>Distribution matching (DM) is a versatile domain-invariant representation learning technique that has been applied to tasks such as fair classification, domain adaptation, and domain translation.Non-parametric DM methods struggle with scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode collapse.While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they often impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit density models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train.We address this limitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM using expressive score-based prior distributions.Our key insight is that gradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its density -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching.This approach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more effective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the challenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based prior).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational efficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, establishing our score-based method as a stable and effective approach to distribution matching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Source code available at https://github.com/inouye-lab/SAUB.</p>

                  <p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks.Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly reduced computational and memory overhead.However, despite its earlier success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been very limited.In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix significance within the attention head.This motivates us to introduce Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module out of the attention head itself.We further provide an overview of our construction process to guide future users when constructing their own context-based methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Our findings suggest that by overcoming its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.</p>

                  <p>Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs, affecting both research and real-world applications.Recently, Nguyen et al. 2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p sampling.The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection for an Oral presentation.This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the original paper's four lines of evidence.First, the original paper's human evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task, and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve over baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the number of hyperparameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported.Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars) were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised adoption claim remains misleading.We conclude that evidence presented in the original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices.By significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and CAD for edge AI deployment.MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for deploying deep neural networks.Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA).The HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm.A key innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial training or hardware simulation.This early filtering drastically reduces the search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high probability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency.Validation on a MAX78000 evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.</p>

In the incomplete information model, voters can vote on only a small portion of the candidates.We suggest a greedy algorithm and a local search algorithm that query voters and use the query responses to approximate the total population's opinion.For both algorithms, we prove an upper bound on the number of queries required to get a close to $(1-1/\e)$-approximate solution with high probability.We also provide a lower bound for the query complexity of non-adaptive algorithms, that cannot adapt their querying strategy to readily obtained information.In the inaccurate information setting, voters' responses are corrupted with a probability $p\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$.

                  <p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges.To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components.First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency.Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals.Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance.We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00.We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation.Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p>

                  <p>There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around steering these models using reward models.Training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough, e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs.In this work, we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism and reward achieved by these methods.Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$ produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS.We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Whereas state-of-the-art baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>We complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the candidate solution closer to the data manifold.To our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions.Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients.While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned.Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality.Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.</p>

                  <p>Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images.However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.   This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.</p>

                  <p>Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management.Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction.However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment.This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline.The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning.Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS).Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error).These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales.This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.</p>

                  <p>We present a novel method for error correction in the presence of fading channel estimation errors (CEE).When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted.Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders.The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate.All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword.The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation.The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes.For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have streamlined front-end interface development by automating code generation.However, these models also introduce challenges in ensuring code quality.Existing approaches struggle to maintain both visual consistency and functional completeness in the generated components.Moreover, they lack mechanisms to assess the fidelity and correctness of the rendered pages.To address these issues, we propose DesignCoder, a novel hierarchical-aware and self-correcting automated code generation framework.Specifically, we introduce UI Grouping Chains, which enhance MLLMs' capability to understand and predict complex nested UI hierarchies.Subsequently, DesignCoder employs a hierarchical divide-and-conquer approach to generate front-end code.Finally, we incorporate a self-correction mechanism to improve the model's ability to identify and rectify errors in the generated code.Extensive evaluations on a dataset of UI mockups collected from both open-source communities and industry projects demonstrate that DesignCoder outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in React Native, a widely adopted UI framework.Our method achieves a 37.63%, 9.52%, 12.82% performance increase in visual similarity metrics (MSE, CLIP, SSIM) and significantly improves code structure similarity in terms of TreeBLEU, Container Match, and Tree Edit Distance by 30.19%, 29.31%, 24.67%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we conducted a user study with professional developers to assess the quality and practicality of the generated code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Results indicate that DesignCoder aligns with industry best practices, demonstrating high usability, readability, and maintainability.Our approach provides an efficient and practical solution for agile front-end development, enabling development teams to focus more on core functionality and product innovation.</p>

We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy).By excluding deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in 53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).   Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based review analytics.This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and ensuring reliable insights.</p>

We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay.RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program.Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size.   We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines.On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time.Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time.We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p>

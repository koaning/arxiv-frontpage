                  <p>Panoramic imaging enables capturing 360{\deg} images with an ultra-wide Field-of-View (FoV) for dense omnidirectional perception.However, current panoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole Out-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the panoramic domain due to background clutter and pixel distortions.To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), achieving OoS for panoramas.Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning.Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP.The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision.Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system.Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods.Moreover, POS achieves leading closed-set segmentation capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/MengfeiD/PanOoS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.913</span></span></p>

                Breaking Annotation Barriers: Generalized Video Quality Assessment via Ranking-based Self-Supervision

                  <p>Video quality assessment (VQA) is essential for quantifying perceptual quality in various video processing workflows, spanning from camera capture systems to over-the-top streaming platforms.While recent supervised VQA models have made substantial progress, the reliance on manually annotated datasets -- a process that is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to scale up -- has hindered further optimization of their generalization to unseen video content and distortions.To bridge this gap, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework for VQA to learn quality assessment capabilities from large-scale, unlabeled web videos.Our approach leverages a \textbf{learning-to-rank} paradigm to train a large multimodal model (LMM) on video pairs automatically labeled via two manners, including quality pseudo-labeling by existing VQA models and relative quality ranking based on synthetic distortion simulations.Furthermore, we introduce a novel \textbf{iterative self-improvement training strategy}, where the trained model acts an improved annotator to iteratively refine the annotation quality of training data.By training on a dataset $10\times$ larger than the existing VQA benchmarks, our model: (1) achieves zero-shot performance on in-domain VQA benchmarks that matches or surpasses supervised models; (2) demonstrates superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization across diverse video content and distortions; and (3) sets a new state-of-the-art when fine-tuned on human-labeled datasets.Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our self-supervised approach in training generalized VQA models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and code will be publicly released to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gait recognition has emerged as a powerful tool for unobtrusive and long-range identity analysis, with growing relevance in surveillance and monitoring applications.Although recent advances in deep learning and large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate recognition under closed-set conditions, real-world deployment demands open-set gait enrollment, which means determining whether a new gait sample corresponds to a known identity or represents a previously unseen individual.In this work, we introduce a transformer-based framework for open-set gait enrollment that is both dataset-agnostic and recognition-architecture-agnostic.Our method leverages a SetTransformer to make enrollment decisions based on the embedding of a probe sample and a context set drawn from the gallery, without requiring task-specific thresholds or retraining for new environments.By decoupling enrollment from the main recognition pipeline, our model is generalized across different datasets, gallery sizes, and identity distributions.We propose an evaluation protocol that uses existing datasets in different ratios of identities and walks per identity.We instantiate our method using skeleton-based gait representations and evaluate it on two benchmark datasets (CASIA-B and PsyMo), using embeddings from three state-of-the-art recognition models (GaitGraph, GaitFormer, and GaitPT).We show that our method is flexible, is able to accurately perform enrollment in different scenarios, and scales better with data compared to traditional approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make the code and dataset scenarios publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction.However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity.To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation.RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation.To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies.This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences.We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities.Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability.Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span></p>

                  <p>Black-box scanners have played a significant role in detecting vulnerabilities for web applications.A key focus in current black-box scanning is increasing test coverage (i.e., accessing more web pages).However, since many web applications are user-oriented, some deep pages can only be accessed through complex user interactions, which are difficult to reach by existing black-box scanners.To fill this gap, a key insight is that web pages contain a wealth of semantic information that can aid in understanding potential user intention.Based on this insight, we propose Hoyen, a black-box scanner that uses the Large Language Model to predict user intention and provide guidance for expanding the scanning scope.Hoyen has been rigorously evaluated on 12 popular open-source web applications and compared with 6 representative tools.The results demonstrate that Hoyen performs a comprehensive exploration of web applications, expanding the attack surface while achieving about 2x than the coverage of other scanners on average, with high request accuracy.Furthermore, Hoyen detected over 90% of its requests towards the core functionality of the application, detecting more vulnerabilities than other scanners, including unique vulnerabilities in well-known web applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data/code is available at https://hoyen.tjunsl.com/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

We highlight for developers that code generated by ChatGPT is more likely to contain vulnerabilities compared to their own code.Furthermore, at times ChatGPT reports incorrect information with apparent confidence, which may mislead less experienced developers.Our findings confirm previous studies in demonstrating that ChatGPT is not sufficiently reliable for generating secure code nor identifying all vulnerabilities, highlighting the continuing importance of static scanners and manual review.</p>

                  <p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs).While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs.The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities.To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training.By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores.Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations.In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp.However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection).In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data.To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available.PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task.Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.</p>

                  <p>Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced "Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to understand human activities in real-world settings.DARai consists of continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10 different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors, biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.   To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks, (ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and (iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.   Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels.To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/software-and-datasets/darai-daily-activity-recordings-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents our winning submission to the AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) competition.Our recipe for building state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning models relies on three key pillars.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we create a large-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems, including olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Second, we develop a novel method to integrate code execution with long reasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering, resulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions.Third, we create a pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from many candidates.We show that such generative solution selection (GenSelect) can significantly improve upon majority voting baseline.Combining these ideas, we train a series of models that achieve state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.To facilitate further research, we release our code, models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under a commercially permissive license.</p>

                  <p>Semi-supervised learning has become a compelling approach for 3D tooth segmentation from CBCT scans, where labeled data is minimal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing methods still face two persistent challenges: limited corrective supervision in structurally ambiguous or mislabeled regions during supervised training and performance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>To address these problems, we propose Region-Aware Instructive Learning (RAIL), a dual-group dual-student, semi-supervised framework.Each group contains two student models guided by a shared teacher network.By alternating training between the two groups, RAIL promotes intergroup knowledge transfer and collaborative region-aware instruction while reducing overfitting to the characteristics of any single model.Specifically, RAIL introduces two instructive mechanisms.Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller improves supervised learning by instructing predictions only within areas where student outputs diverge from both ground truth and the best student, thereby concentrating supervision on structurally ambiguous or mislabeled areas.In the unsupervised phase, Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator reinforces agreement in regions with high model certainty while reducing the effect of low-confidence predictions during training.This helps prevent our model from learning unstable patterns and improves the overall reliability of pseudo-labels.Extensive experiments on four CBCT tooth segmentation datasets show that RAIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods under limited annotation.Our code will be available at https://github.com/Tournesol-Saturday/RAIL.</p>

                  <p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations.In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data.To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available.PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function.We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph.Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task.Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.</p>

                  <p>In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state.An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment.These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP.We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules.We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalization capability.Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.</p>

                  <p>The analysis of network assortativity is of great importance for understanding the structural characteristics of and dynamics upon networks.Often, network assortativity is quantified using the assortativity coefficient that is defined based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between vertex degrees.It is well known that a network may contain sensitive information, such as the number of friends of an individual in a social network (which is abstracted as the degree of vertex.).So, the computation of the assortativity coefficient leads to privacy leakage, which increases the urgent need for privacy-preserving protocol.However, there has been no scheme addressing the concern above.   To bridge this gap, in this work, we are the first to propose approaches based on differential privacy (DP for short).Specifically, we design three DP-based algorithms: $Local_{ru}$, $Shuffle_{ru}$, and $Decentral_{ru}$. The first two algorithms, based on Local DP (LDP) and Shuffle DP respectively, are designed for settings where each individual only knows his/her direct friends.In contrast, the third algorithm, based on Decentralized DP (DDP), targets scenarios where each individual has a broader view, i.e., also knowing his/her friends' friends.Theoretically, we prove that each algorithm enables an unbiased estimation of the assortativity coefficient of the network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms using mean squared error (MSE), showing that $Shuffle_{ru}$ achieves the best performance, followed by $Decentral_{ru}$, with $Local_{ru}$ performing the worst. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Note that these three algorithms have different assumptions, so each has its applicability scenario.Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical simulations, which demonstrate that the presented approaches are adequate to achieve the estimation of network assortativity under the demand for privacy protection.</p>

                  <p>Accurate fetal brain tissue segmentation and biometric analysis are essential for studying brain development in utero.The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new task alongside tissue segmentation.For the first time, our diverse multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler characteristic difference (ED). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods, most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans.However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability.The ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores, highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with high-quality reconstruction.Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting reliable biometric estimates from image data alone.Domain shift analysis identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial role.Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site, had smaller, though still measurable, effects.Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically robust and generalizable AI tools.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance generation quality of the diffusion transformers.However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an additional and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process.In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components.We therefore propose Self-Representation A}lignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtain representation guidance through a self-distillation manner.Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only generative training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.</p>

                  <p>Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendations.However, we identify potential bottlenecks in two foundational components.First, the embedding layer leads to a latent space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially valuable preference patterns.Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a fine-grained manner.Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum and a restricted linear form.To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a CF framework based on graph spectral filtering.Instead of a learned embedding, it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of signals contained in it.Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.</p>

                  <p>In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can significantly impact outcomes.Objects that are heavily occluded or intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human observation or through advanced technological applications.While certain Deep Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in handling distant information, e.g., transformers.In X-ray security imaging the literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been sufficiently explored.In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline, namely YOLOv8.In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer (Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR).The resulting architectures are comparatively evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS, HiXray, and PIDray.Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer architectures exhibit increased robustness.Detailed comparative evaluation results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural combination and suggest guidelines for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and network weights of the models employed in this study are available at https://github.com/jgenc/xray-comparative-evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series.However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values.The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights.To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling.Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing logical deductions that can be made from trained information.These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some of these cases.Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning.To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data.The datasets are constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining, to create clean tests of generalization.We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization.We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge).We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Our results have implications for understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model.The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications.Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques.In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks.In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance.To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB.Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models.After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction.In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples.To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</p>

                  <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face challenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of annotated data.This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification.We conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline.Anomaly maps, generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the external test set, adU-Net achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net model (0.605). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa identification.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use.However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism.Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.   This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities.To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data.For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise.Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic.At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning.   Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors.We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy".Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents.We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement:First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%.Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents.Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

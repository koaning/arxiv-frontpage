                  <p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations.In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp.However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection).In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data.To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available.PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task.Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.</p>

                  <p>Recovering 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) from single color images is challenging due to depth ambiguities, occlusions, and the huge variation in object shape and appearance.Thus, past work requires controlled settings such as known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.Instead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset of natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object meshes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are paired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D body.In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object.To infer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a database by leveraging vision foundation models.Then, we project DAMON's body contact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per patch.This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences between bodies and objects.(2) We exploit our new dataset of contact correspondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit, to recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction.PICO-fit infers contact for the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db for that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object meshes to image evidence via optimization.Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for many object categories that no existing method can tackle.This is crucial to enable HOI understanding to scale in the wild.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and code are available at https://pico.is.tue.mpg.de. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.915</span></span></p>

                  <p>Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced "Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to understand human activities in real-world settings.DARai consists of continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10 different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors, biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.   To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks, (ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and (iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.   Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels.To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/software-and-datasets/darai-daily-activity-recordings-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>Flaky tests produce inconsistent outcomes without code changes, creating major challenges for software developers.An industrial case study reported that developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly cost of $2,250.We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with co-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic flakiness.This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing shared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather than tackling them individually.This study represents an inflection point by challenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated occurrences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24 Java projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job scheduling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>It contains 810 flaky tests, which we levered to perform a mixed-method empirical analysis of co-occurring flaky test failures.Systemic flakiness is significant and widespread.We performed agglomerative clustering of flaky tests based on their failure co-occurrence, finding that 75% of flaky tests across all projects belong to a cluster, with a mean cluster size of 13.5 flaky tests.Instead of requiring 10,000 test suite runs to identify systemic flakiness, we demonstrated a lightweight alternative by training machine learning models based on static test case distance measures.Through manual inspection of stack traces, conducted independently by four authors and resolved through negotiated agreement, we identified intermittent networking issues and instabilities in external dependencies as the predominant causes of systemic flakiness.</p>

                  <p>Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge.Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL).However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system.During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location.Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers.The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments.To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions.It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems.However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases.We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation.By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files.The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness.We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques.We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust.The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting.Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos.Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies.In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events.Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning.Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features.Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features.The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency.Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models.However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs.As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation.This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions.Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations.Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model.2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts.Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work.Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>Referring Expression Generation (REG) is a core task for evaluating the pragmatic competence of vision-language systems, requiring not only accurate semantic grounding but also adherence to principles of cooperative communication (Grice, 1975).However, current evaluations of vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook the pragmatic dimension, reducing REG to a region-based captioning task and neglecting Gricean maxims.In this work, we revisit REG from a pragmatic perspective, introducing a new dataset (RefOI) of 1.5k images annotated with both written and spoken referring expressions.Through a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, we identify three key failures of pragmatic competence: (1) failure to uniquely identify the referent, (2) inclusion of excessive or irrelevant information, and (3) misalignment with human pragmatic preference, such as the underuse of minimal spatial cues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that standard automatic evaluations fail to capture these pragmatic violations, reinforcing superficial cues rather than genuine referential success. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Our findings call for a renewed focus on pragmatically informed models and evaluation frameworks that align with real human communication.</p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments.Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label.Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings.We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks.Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application.Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments.Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.</p>

                  <p>In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks.Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs.Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues.These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable.To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data.Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate.Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions).This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level.Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fitting distances to tree metrics and ultrametrics are two widely used methods in hierarchical clustering, primarily explored within the context of numerical taxonomy.Given a positive distance function $D:\binom{V}{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or ultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference between the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is minimized.In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric fitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs of elements from $V$ (with $|V|=n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in an arbitrary order.We study these problems under various distance norms:   For the $\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time $\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove that no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we show that the algorithm for $\ell_0$ implies an $O(\Delta/\delta)$ approximation for the $\ell_1$ objective, where $\Delta$ is the maximum and $\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>This bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a combinatorial algorithm when $\Delta/\delta=O(n)$.

                  <p>We consider the Minimum Multi-Commodity Flow Subgraph (MMCFS) problem: given a directed graph $G$ with edge capacities $\mathit{cap}$ and a retention ratio $\alpha\in(0,1)$, find an edge-wise minimum subgraph $G' \subseteq G$ such that for all traffic matrices $T$ routable in $G$ using a multi-commodity flow, $\alpha\cdot T$ is routable in $G'$. This natural yet novel problem is motivated by recent research that investigates how the power consumption in backbone computer networks can be reduced by turning off connections during times of low demand without compromising the quality of service.Since the actual traffic demands are generally not known beforehand, our approach must be traffic-oblivious, i.e., work for all possible sets of simultaneously routable traffic demands in the original network.   In this paper we present the problem, relate it to other known problems in literature, and show several structural results, including a reformulation, maximum possible deviations from the optimum, and NP-hardness (as well as a certain inapproximability) already on very restricted instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The most significant contribution is a tight $\max(\frac{1}{\alpha}, 2)$-approximation based on an algorithmically surprisingly simple LP-rounding scheme. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term devices.However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit increases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of parameters to optimize grows linearly.This results in more iterations required by the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden as more circuit executions are needed.To mitigate this issue, we introduce QAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space.By extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem instances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on larger instances.Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem demonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this comes at the cost of a slight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number of layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by parameter count. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising solution quality.</p>

                  <p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities.However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes.Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space.To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities.To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average.Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning.To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types.Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally.Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets.Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA</p>

Given a graph class $\mathcal{H}$, we consider a general family of graph modification problems, called $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$, where the input is a graph $G$ and the question is whether it is possible to replace some induced subgraph $H_1$ of $G$ on at most $k$ vertices by a graph $H_2$ in $\mathcal{L}(H_1)$ so that the resulting graph belongs to $\mathcal{H}$. $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$ can simulate many graph modification problems including vertex deletion, edge deletion/addition/edition/contraction, vertex identification, subgraph complementation, independent set deletion, (induced) matching deletion/contraction, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present two algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>The first one solves $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$ in time $2^{{\rm poly}(k)}\cdot |V(G)|^2$ for every minor-closed graph class $\mathcal{H}$, where {\rm poly} is a polynomial whose degree depends on $\mathcal{H}$, under a mild technical condition on $\mathcal{L}$. This generalizes the results of Morelle, Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020, ICALP 2023] for the particular case of Vertex Deletion to $\mathcal{H}$ within the same running time.Our second algorithm is an improvement of the first one when $\mathcal{H}$ is the class of graphs embeddable in a surface of Euler genus at most $g$ and runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^{9})}\cdot |V(G)|^2$, where the $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$ notation depends on $g$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parameterized algorithms with a reasonable parametric dependence for such a general family of graph modification problems to minor-closed classes.</p>

                  <p>Optimization plays a vital role in scientific research and practical applications, but formulating a concrete optimization problem described in natural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to solve the problem requires substantial domain expertise.We introduce \textbf{OptimAI}, a framework for solving \underline{Optim}ization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered \underline{AI} agents, achieving superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.Our framework is built upon four key roles: (1) a \emph{formulator} that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a \emph{planner} that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a \emph{coder} and a \emph{code critic} capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions.Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively.Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain.Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, allowing us to conveniently explore the synergistic effect of combining diverse models within a unified system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach attains 88.1\% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 71.2\% on the Optibench (non-linear w/o table) subset, reducing error rates by 58\% and 50\% respectively over prior best results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce PHYBench, a novel, high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in physical contexts.PHYBench consists of 500 meticulously curated physics problems based on real-world physical scenarios, designed to assess the ability of models to understand and reason about realistic physical processes.Covering mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, modern physics, and advanced physics, the benchmark spans difficulty levels from high school exercises to undergraduate problems and Physics Olympiad challenges.Additionally, we propose the Expression Edit Distance (EED) Score, a novel evaluation metric based on the edit distance between mathematical expressions, which effectively captures differences in model reasoning processes and results beyond traditional binary scoring methods.We evaluate various LLMs on PHYBench and compare their performance with human experts.Our results reveal that even state-of-the-art reasoning models significantly lag behind human experts, highlighting their limitations and the need for improvement in complex physical reasoning scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark results and dataset are publicly available at https://phybench-official.github.io/phybench-demo/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents.While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence.To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes.Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views.Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency.Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses.These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness.We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://danielchyeh.github.io/All-Angles-Bench/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

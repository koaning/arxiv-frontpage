                  <p>Falsely annotated samples, also known as noisy labels, can significantly harm the performance of deep learning models.Two main approaches for learning with noisy labels are global noise estimation and data filtering.Global noise estimation approximates the noise across the entire dataset using a noise transition matrix, but it can unnecessarily adjust correct labels, leaving room for local improvements.Data filtering, on the other hand, discards potentially noisy samples but risks losing valuable data.Our method identifies potentially noisy samples based on their loss distribution.We then apply a selection process to separate noisy and clean samples and learn a noise transition matrix to correct the loss for noisy samples while leaving the clean data unaffected, thereby improving the training process.Our approach ensures robust learning and enhanced model performance by preserving valuable information from noisy samples and refining the correction process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We applied our method to standard image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) and a biological scRNA-seq cell-type annotation dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>We observed a significant improvement in model accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.</p>

                  <p>Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) plays a crucial role in visual affective computing, aiming to infer a person's emotional state based on facial data.Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs) that provide detailed emotional insights.However, traditional methods often struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and reasoning abilities.Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various visual tasks, while they still face significant challenges in FEA due to the lack of specialized datasets and their inability to capture the intricate relationships between FEs and AUs.To address these issues, we introduce a novel FEA Instruction Dataset that provides accurate and aligned FE and AU descriptions and establishes causal reasoning relationships between them, followed by constructing a new benchmark, FEABench.Moreover, we propose FEALLM, a novel MLLM architecture designed to capture more detailed facial information, enhancing its capability in FEA tasks.Our model demonstrates strong performance on FEABench and impressive generalization capability through zero-shot evaluation on various datasets, including RAF-DB, AffectNet, BP4D, and DISFA, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in FEA tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/953206211/FEALLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span></p>

                  <p>Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant to enhance user experience.This calls for designing methods that can allow users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate.For example, controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc.Most existing work attempts to integrate users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale.In this work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or via existing techniques in conditional generation.Through a case study in controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a "low" and a "high" token embedding.Our method more reliably exerts response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods that represent the control signal as a discrete signal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our full open-sourced code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure.Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics.Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors.In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities.In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models.By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner.The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project page is https://customsvg.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks.Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results.Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks.However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task.To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas.Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge.We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span></p>

                  <p>This work introduces the first benchmark for nursing value alignment, consisting of five core value dimensions distilled from international nursing codes: Altruism, Human Dignity, Integrity, Justice, and Professionalism.The benchmark comprises 1,100 real-world nursing behavior instances collected through a five-month longitudinal field study across three hospitals of varying tiers.These instances are annotated by five clinical nurses and then augmented with LLM-generated counterfactuals with reversed ethic polarity.Each original case is paired with a value-aligned and a value-violating version, resulting in 2,200 labeled instances that constitute the Easy-Level dataset.To increase adversarial complexity, each instance is further transformed into a dialogue-based format that embeds contextual cues and subtle misleading signals, yielding a Hard-Level dataset.We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs on their alignment with nursing values.Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest performance on the Easy-Level dataset (94.55), where Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms other models on the Hard-Level dataset (89.43), significantly surpassing the medical LLMs; (2) Justice is consistently the most difficult nursing value dimension to evaluate; and (3) in-context learning significantly improves alignment.This work aims to provide a foundation for value-sensitive LLMs development in clinical settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and the code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ben012345/NurValues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.896</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next preferences based on their interaction histories, but existing approaches face critical limitations in efficiency and multi-scale pattern recognition.While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features.To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating.First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise.Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions.Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion.Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines.Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M2Rec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering.The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment:The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks.Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications.Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability.We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.</p>

                  <p>Few-shot cross-modal retrieval focuses on learning cross-modal representations with limited training samples, enabling the model to handle unseen classes during inference.Unlike traditional cross-modal retrieval tasks, which assume that both training and testing data share the same class distribution, few-shot retrieval involves data with sparse representations across modalities.Existing methods often fail to adequately model the multi-peak distribution of few-shot cross-modal data, resulting in two main biases in the latent semantic space: intra-modal bias, where sparse samples fail to capture intra-class diversity, and inter-modal bias, where misalignments between image and text distributions exacerbate the semantic gap.These biases hinder retrieval accuracy.To address these issues, we propose a novel method, GCRDP, for few-shot cross-modal retrieval.This approach effectively captures the complex multi-peak distribution of data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and incorporates a multi-positive sample contrastive learning mechanism for comprehensive feature modeling.Additionally, we introduce a new strategy for cross-modal semantic alignment, which constrains the relative distances between image and text feature distributions, thereby improving the accuracy of cross-modal representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising performance in solving complex tasks.LRMs solve tasks that require complex reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with answers.Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well.Logically, if the soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the confidence of the derived answer should be low.Existing methods did consider jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly reflected.In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation.Specifically, our CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process, which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field.Our CoT-Kinetics energy assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework, such as $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$. After over a decade of $\sf Adam$'s dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements, offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency, better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training.However, a significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes.To address both, we propose a new LMO-based method called $\sf Gluon$, capturing prior theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical predictive power.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors.In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities.In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models.By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>The project page is https://customsvg.github.io.</p>

In this work, we introduce Multi-Source Data Transfer Protocol, MDTP, which further improves multi-source transfer performance.MDTP logically divides a file request into smaller chunk requests and distributes the chunk requests across multiple servers.Chunk sizes are adapted based on each server's performance but selected in a way that ensures each round of requests completes around the same time.We formulate this chunk-size allocation problem as a variant of the bin-packing problem, where adaptive chunking efficiently fills the available capacity "bins" corresponding to each server.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation shows that MDTP reduces transfer times by 10-22% compared to Aria2, the fastest alternative. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Comparisons with other protocols, such as static chunking and BitTorrent, demonstrate even greater improvements.Additionally, we show that MDTP distributes load proportionally across all available replicas, not just the fastest ones, which improves throughput.Finally, we show MDTP maintains high throughput even when latency increases or bandwidth to the fastest server decreases.</p>

                  <p>Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world scenarios.However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC theory, resulting in limited interpretability.Therefore, we propose AC-Reason, a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g., sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a theory-guided algorithm with explanations.While AC-Reason does not explicitly construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal structure to support principled reasoning.To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ).AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on actual causation.The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench present greater challenges for LLMs.Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over baselines.On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On AC-Bench, GPT-4 + AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>AC-Bench further enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts.Finally, our ablation study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.</p>

                  <p>Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance.Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma.To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects.This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities.To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition.Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search.Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks.This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search.Dataset and source code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CityAVOS-3DF8.</p>

                  <p>Secure Aggregation (SA) is an indispensable component of Federated Learning (FL) that concentrates on privacy preservation while allowing for robust aggregation.However, most SA designs rely heavily on the unrealistic assumption of homogeneous model architectures.Federated Distillation (FD), which aggregates locally computed logits instead of model parameters, introduces a promising alternative for cooperative training in heterogeneous model settings.Nevertheless, we recognize two major challenges in implementing SA for FD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(i) Prior SA designs encourage a dominant server, who is solely responsible for collecting, aggregating and distributing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Such central authority facilitates server to forge aggregation proofs or collude to bypass the claimed security guarantees; (ii) Existing SA, tailored for FL models, overlook the intrinsic properties of logits, making them unsuitable for FD.   To address these challenges, we propose SVAFD, the first SA protocol that is specifically designed for FD.At a high level, SVAFD incorporates two innovations: (i) a multilateral co-aggregation method tha redefines the responsibilities of clients and server.Clients autonomously evaluate and aggregate logits shares locally with a lightweight coding scheme, while the server handles ciphertext decoding and performs the task of generating verification proofs; (ii) a quality-aware knowledge filtration method that facilitates biased logits exclusion against poisoning attacks.Moreover, SVAFD is resilient to stragglers and colluding clients, making it well-suited for dynamic networks in real-world applications.We have implemented the SVAFD prototype over four emerging FD architectures and evaluated it against poisoning and inference attacks.Results demonstrate that SVAFD improves model accuracy, making it a significant step forward in secure and verifiable aggregation for heterogeneous FL systems.</p>

                  <p>Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures could achieve impressive computational efficiency with expert parallelism, which relies heavily on all-to-all communication across devices.Unfortunately, such communication overhead typically constitutes a significant portion of the total runtime, hampering the scalability of distributed training and inference for modern MoE models (consuming over $40\%$ runtime in large-scale training).In this paper, we first define collaborative communication to illustrate this intrinsic limitation, and then propose system- and algorithm-level innovations to reduce communication costs.Specifically, given a pair of experts co-activated by one token, we call them "collaborated", which comprises $2$ cases as intra- and inter-collaboration, depending on whether they are kept on the same device.Our pilot investigations reveal that augmenting the proportion of intra-collaboration can accelerate expert parallelism at scale.It motivates us to strategically optimize collaborative communication for accelerated MoE training and inference, dubbed Occult.Our designs are capable of either delivering exact results with reduced communication cost or controllably minimizing the cost with collaboration pruning, materialized by modified fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments on various MoE-LLMs demonstrate that Occult can be faster than popular state-of-the-art inference or training frameworks (more than $1.5\times$ speed up across multiple tasks and models) with comparable or superior quality compared to the standard fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Code is available at $\href{https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/Occult}{https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/Occult}$.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning, have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical inference.However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems admit straightforward solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This motivates an open question: Can LLMs learn when to think? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed reasoning.At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the accuracy of the generated answers.This decoupled formulation enables fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% - 90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.The code is available at https://github.com/VainF/Thinkless</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation.However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before.Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation.Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding.Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent.We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval.Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis.Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

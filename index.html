                  <p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations.In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp.However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection).In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data.To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available.PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task.Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.</p>

                  <p>Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced "Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to understand human activities in real-world settings.DARai consists of continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10 different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors, biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.   To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks, (ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and (iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.   Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels.To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/software-and-datasets/darai-daily-activity-recordings-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>Flaky tests produce inconsistent outcomes without code changes, creating major challenges for software developers.An industrial case study reported that developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly cost of $2,250.We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with co-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic flakiness.This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing shared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather than tackling them individually.This study represents an inflection point by challenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated occurrences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24 Java projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job scheduling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>It contains 810 flaky tests, which we levered to perform a mixed-method empirical analysis of co-occurring flaky test failures.Systemic flakiness is significant and widespread.We performed agglomerative clustering of flaky tests based on their failure co-occurrence, finding that 75% of flaky tests across all projects belong to a cluster, with a mean cluster size of 13.5 flaky tests.Instead of requiring 10,000 test suite runs to identify systemic flakiness, we demonstrated a lightweight alternative by training machine learning models based on static test case distance measures.Through manual inspection of stack traces, conducted independently by four authors and resolved through negotiated agreement, we identified intermittent networking issues and instabilities in external dependencies as the predominant causes of systemic flakiness.</p>

                  <p>Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge.Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL).However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system.During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location.Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers.The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments.To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions.It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Topics over Time (ToT) model captures thematic changes in timestamped datasets by explicitly modeling publication dates jointly with word co-occurrence patterns.However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian fashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems.To address this issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the introduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution.This prior acts as a regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from unstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch.The characteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the first time.Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the single-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document.A variation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a solution.In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times per document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps along the inference process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have tested our models on two datasets: a collection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>The results show that WBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA topic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence over time is reduced by $51\%$ and $34\%$, respectively.Our experiments also demonstrate the superior coherence of WBToT over BToT, which highlights the importance of balancing the time and word modalities.Finally, we illustrate the stability of the online optimization algorithm in WBToT, which allows the application of WBToT to problems that are intractable for standard ToT.</p>

                  <p>C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems.However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases.We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation.By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files.The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness.We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques.We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust.The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting.Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models.However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs.As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation.This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions.Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations.Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model.2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts.Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work.Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>While recent video deblurring methods have advanced significantly, they often overlook two valuable prior information: (1) motion vectors (MVs) and coding residuals (CRs) from video codecs, which provide efficient inter-frame alignment cues, and (2) the rich real-world knowledge embedded in pre-trained diffusion generative models.We present CPGDNet, a novel two-stage framework that effectively leverages both coding priors and generative diffusion priors for high-quality deblurring.First, our coding-prior feature propagation (CPFP) module utilizes MVs for efficient frame alignment and CRs to generate attention masks, addressing motion inaccuracies and texture variations.Second, a coding-prior controlled generation (CPC) module network integrates coding priors into a pretrained diffusion model, guiding it to enhance critical regions and synthesize realistic details.Experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with up to 30% improvement in IQA metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the code and the codingprior-augmented dataset will be open-sourced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA).Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics.The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement.We compare the proposed method with existing approaches in a low-dimensional visualization example and a parametric static problem, and demonstrate its performance in a dynamics model of a space structure.</p>

                  <p>Vector search plays a crucial role in many real-world applications.In addition to single-vector search, multi-vector search becomes important for multi-modal and multi-feature scenarios today.In a multi-vector database, each row is an item, each column represents a feature of items, and each cell is a high-dimensional vector.In multi-vector databases, the choice of indexes can have a significant impact on performance.Although index tuning for relational databases has been extensively studied, index tuning for multi-vector search remains unclear and challenging.In this paper, we define multi-vector search index tuning and propose a framework to solve it.Specifically, given a multi-vector search workload, we develop algorithms to find indexes that minimize latency and meet storage and recall constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the baseline, our latency achieves 2.1X to 8.3X speedup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>While Structure-from-Motion (SfM) has seen much progress over the years, state-of-the-art systems are prone to failure when facing extreme viewpoint changes in low-overlap, low-parallax or high-symmetry scenarios.Because capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits the wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users.We overcome these limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and normal priors inferred by deep neural networks.Thanks to a tight integration of monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong performance in standard conditions.We also show that monocular priors can help reject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem for SfM.This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing challenging indoor environments from few images.Through principled uncertainty propagation, it is robust to errors in the priors, can handle priors inferred by different models with little tuning, and will thus easily benefit from future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cvg/mpsfm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines.Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures.Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers.In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture.Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count.Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.</p>

                  <p>In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks.Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs.Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues.These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable.To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data.Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate.Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions).This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level.Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fitting distances to tree metrics and ultrametrics are two widely used methods in hierarchical clustering, primarily explored within the context of numerical taxonomy.Given a positive distance function $D:\binom{V}{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or ultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference between the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is minimized.In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric fitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs of elements from $V$ (with $|V|=n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in an arbitrary order.We study these problems under various distance norms:   For the $\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time $\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove that no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we show that the algorithm for $\ell_0$ implies an $O(\Delta/\delta)$ approximation for the $\ell_1$ objective, where $\Delta$ is the maximum and $\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>This bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a combinatorial algorithm when $\Delta/\delta=O(n)$.

This natural yet novel problem is motivated by recent research that investigates how the power consumption in backbone computer networks can be reduced by turning off connections during times of low demand without compromising the quality of service.Since the actual traffic demands are generally not known beforehand, our approach must be traffic-oblivious, i.e., work for all possible sets of simultaneously routable traffic demands in the original network.

                  <p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently made progress as an unsupervised graph representation learning paradigm.GCL approaches can be categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods.The former relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that can generate distinct views of the same input.Both approaches may require negative samples for training.In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models.Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE).Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator.We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning.Our model does not require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term devices.However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit increases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of parameters to optimize grows linearly.This results in more iterations required by the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden as more circuit executions are needed.To mitigate this issue, we introduce QAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space.By extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem instances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on larger instances.Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem demonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this comes at the cost of a slight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number of layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by parameter count. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising solution quality.</p>

                  <p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities.However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes.Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space.To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities.To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average.Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning.To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types.Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally.Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets.Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA</p>

                  <p>A replacement action is a function $\mathcal{L}$ that maps each graph $H$ to a collection of graphs of size at most $|V(H)|$. Given a graph class $\mathcal{H}$, we consider a general family of graph modification problems, called $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$, where the input is a graph $G$ and the question is whether it is possible to replace some induced subgraph $H_1$ of $G$ on at most $k$ vertices by a graph $H_2$ in $\mathcal{L}(H_1)$ so that the resulting graph belongs to $\mathcal{H}$. $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$ can simulate many graph modification problems including vertex deletion, edge deletion/addition/edition/contraction, vertex identification, subgraph complementation, independent set deletion, (induced) matching deletion/contraction, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present two algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>The first one solves $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$ in time $2^{{\rm poly}(k)}\cdot |V(G)|^2$ for every minor-closed graph class $\mathcal{H}$, where {\rm poly} is a polynomial whose degree depends on $\mathcal{H}$, under a mild technical condition on $\mathcal{L}$. This generalizes the results of Morelle, Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020, ICALP 2023] for the particular case of Vertex Deletion to $\mathcal{H}$ within the same running time.Our second algorithm is an improvement of the first one when $\mathcal{H}$ is the class of graphs embeddable in a surface of Euler genus at most $g$ and runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^{9})}\cdot |V(G)|^2$, where the $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$ notation depends on $g$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parameterized algorithms with a reasonable parametric dependence for such a general family of graph modification problems to minor-closed classes.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) remain difficult to evaluate comprehensively, particularly for languages other than English, where high-quality data is often limited.Existing benchmarks and leaderboards are predominantly English-centric, with only a few addressing other languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These benchmarks fall short in several key areas: they overlook the diversity of language varieties, prioritize fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities over tasks of industrial relevance, and are static. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>With these aspects in mind, we present IberBench, a comprehensive and extensible benchmark designed to assess LLM performance on both fundamental and industry-relevant NLP tasks, in languages spoken across the Iberian Peninsula and Ibero-America.IberBench integrates 101 datasets from evaluation campaigns and recent benchmarks, covering 22 task categories such as sentiment and emotion analysis, toxicity detection, and summarization.The benchmark addresses key limitations in current evaluation practices, such as the lack of linguistic diversity and static evaluation setups by enabling continual updates and community-driven model and dataset submissions moderated by a committee of experts.We evaluate 23 LLMs ranging from 100 million to 14 billion parameters and provide empirical insights into their strengths and limitations.Our findings indicate that (i) LLMs perform worse on industry-relevant tasks than in fundamental ones, (ii) performance is on average lower for Galician and Basque, (iii) some tasks show results close to random, and (iv) in other tasks LLMs perform above random but below shared task systems.IberBench offers open-source implementations for the entire evaluation pipeline, including dataset normalization and hosting, incremental evaluation of LLMs, and a publicly accessible leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>Multi-label requirements classification is a challenging task, especially when dealing with numerous classes at varying levels of abstraction.The difficulties increases when a limited number of requirements is available to train a supervised classifier.Zero-shot learning (ZSL) does not require training data and can potentially address this problem.This paper investigates the performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial dataset.We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed to support requirements tracing.We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using different embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number of parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large number of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama.Our ground truth includes 377 requirements and 1968 labels from 6 output spaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the evaluation, we adopt traditional metrics, i.e., precision, recall, F1, and $F_\beta$, as well as a novel label distance metric Dn. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>This aims to better capture the classification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of how far the results are from the ground truth.1)The top-performing model on 5 out of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04, while BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum $F_\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04.2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the best classification results compared to LLMs.Thus, addressing the problem in practice is feasible as limited computing power is needed.3) The model architecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence) significantly affects the classifier's performance.We conclude that using ZSL for multi-label requirements classification offers promising results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present a novel metric that can be used to select the top-performing model for this problem <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

This improves on the fastest previously published algorithm, which runs in time $2^{\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})}$[KKMS08].   - Building on the ideas in our agnostic conjunction learner and using significant additional technical ingredients, we give an adaptive tolerant testing algorithm for $k$-juntas that makes $2^{\widetilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$ queries, for constant "gap parameter" $\varepsilon$ between the "near" and "far" cases.This improves on the best previous results, due to [ITW21, NP24], which make $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})}$ queries.Since there is a known $2^{\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{k})}$ lower bound for non-adaptive tolerant junta testers, our result shows that adaptive tolerant junta testing algorithms provably outperform non-adaptive ones.</p>

                  <p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes.They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems.Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding.In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance.Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations.In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles.While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases.We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement.Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution.We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts.Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class.Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent.Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

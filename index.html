                  <p>Black-box scanners have played a significant role in detecting vulnerabilities for web applications.A key focus in current black-box scanning is increasing test coverage (i.e., accessing more web pages).However, since many web applications are user-oriented, some deep pages can only be accessed through complex user interactions, which are difficult to reach by existing black-box scanners.To fill this gap, a key insight is that web pages contain a wealth of semantic information that can aid in understanding potential user intention.Based on this insight, we propose Hoyen, a black-box scanner that uses the Large Language Model to predict user intention and provide guidance for expanding the scanning scope.Hoyen has been rigorously evaluated on 12 popular open-source web applications and compared with 6 representative tools.The results demonstrate that Hoyen performs a comprehensive exploration of web applications, expanding the attack surface while achieving about 2x than the coverage of other scanners on average, with high request accuracy.Furthermore, Hoyen detected over 90% of its requests towards the core functionality of the application, detecting more vulnerabilities than other scanners, including unique vulnerabilities in well-known web applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data/code is available at https://hoyen.tjunsl.com/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs).While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs.The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities.To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training.By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores.Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels.To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/software-and-datasets/darai-daily-activity-recordings-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks.However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context.In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets.Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective.These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed.Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.</p>

                  <p>Flaky tests produce inconsistent outcomes without code changes, creating major challenges for software developers.An industrial case study reported that developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly cost of $2,250.We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with co-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic flakiness.This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing shared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather than tackling them individually.This study represents an inflection point by challenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated occurrences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24 Java projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job scheduling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>It contains 810 flaky tests, which we levered to perform a mixed-method empirical analysis of co-occurring flaky test failures.Systemic flakiness is significant and widespread.We performed agglomerative clustering of flaky tests based on their failure co-occurrence, finding that 75% of flaky tests across all projects belong to a cluster, with a mean cluster size of 13.5 flaky tests.Instead of requiring 10,000 test suite runs to identify systemic flakiness, we demonstrated a lightweight alternative by training machine learning models based on static test case distance measures.Through manual inspection of stack traces, conducted independently by four authors and resolved through negotiated agreement, we identified intermittent networking issues and instabilities in external dependencies as the predominant causes of systemic flakiness.</p>

                  <p>Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge.Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL).However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system.During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location.Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers.The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments.To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions.It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to the development of lightweight language models.Previous work in this area has primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods.Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for evaluating language models without the need for training.However, prevailing approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies.In this paper, we introduce weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored for lightweight language models.Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies: the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating lightweight language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous state-of-the-art training-based methods.Furthermore, we perform ranking evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space.Our approach exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models.However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs.As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation.This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions.Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations.Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model.2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts.Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work.Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged.As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate.They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses.To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations.xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions.To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales.In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%.Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance.These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.</p>

                  <p>Recently, long-thought reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but often incur substantial inference overhead, making efficiency a critical concern.Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit of using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate reasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy.This motivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the input.However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning paths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT paradigm.To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive and efficient reasoning.First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by merging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles.Second, we apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable reasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within each style group (instance-level).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline approaches, while maintaining performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Notably, on five mathematical datasets, the average length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%, highlighting the potential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning efficiency in large language models.Our code is coming soon at https://github.com/StarDewXXX/AdaR1</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model.The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications.Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques.In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks.In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance.To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB.Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models.After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction.In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples.To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in addressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks.However, recent studies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial attacks.Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real world, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks and enhance the robustness of GNNs.Despite the commendable performance of these defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural bias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail nodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes with low degree in the clean graph.Therefore, in this work, we propose a defense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN augmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to mitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks.Notably, the hetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low degree.To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is adopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of graph views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and debiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Salient Object Detection (SOD) methods can locate objects that stand out in an image, assign higher values to their pixels in a saliency map, and binarize the map outputting a predicted segmentation mask.A recent tendency is to investigate pre-trained lightweight models rather than deep neural networks in SOD tasks, coping with applications under limited computational resources.In this context, we have investigated lightweight networks using a methodology named Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), which assumes that the encoder's kernels can be estimated from marker pixels on discriminative regions of a few representative images.This work proposes flyweight networks, hundreds of times lighter than lightweight models, for SOD by combining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, whose weights are estimated for each input image by a given heuristic function.Such FLIM networks are trained from three to four representative images only and without backpropagation, making the models suitable for applications under labeled data constraints as well.We study five adaptive decoders; two of them are introduced here.Differently from the previous ones that rely on one neuron per pixel with shared weights, the heuristic functions of the new adaptive decoders estimate the weights of each neuron per pixel.We compare FLIM models with adaptive decoders for two challenging SOD tasks with three lightweight networks from the state-of-the-art, two FLIM networks with decoders trained by backpropagation, and one FLIM network whose labeled markers define the decoder's weights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed networks over the baselines, revealing the importance of further investigating such methods in new applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying subgroups that benefit from specific treatments using observational data is a critical challenge in personalized medicine.Most existing approaches solely focus on identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect.However, practical considerations, such as ensuring a minimum subgroup size for representativeness or achieving sufficient confounder balance for reliability, are also important for making findings clinically meaningful and actionable.While some studies address these constraints individually, none offer a unified approach to handle them simultaneously.To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic framework for optimal subgroup identification under multiple constraints.We reformulate this combinatorial problem as an unconstrained min-max optimization problem with novel modifications and solve it by a gradient descent ascent algorithm.We further prove its convergence to a feasible and locally optimal solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method is stable and highly flexible, supporting various models and techniques for estimating and optimizing treatment effectiveness with observational data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying subgroups that satisfy multiple constraints, achieving higher treatment effects and better confounder balancing results across different group sizes.</p>

                  <p>Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills.For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently.DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them.However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them.In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects.This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity.The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it.To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS.Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs.RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.</p>

                  <p>Vector search plays a crucial role in many real-world applications.In addition to single-vector search, multi-vector search becomes important for multi-modal and multi-feature scenarios today.In a multi-vector database, each row is an item, each column represents a feature of items, and each cell is a high-dimensional vector.In multi-vector databases, the choice of indexes can have a significant impact on performance.Although index tuning for relational databases has been extensively studied, index tuning for multi-vector search remains unclear and challenging.In this paper, we define multi-vector search index tuning and propose a framework to solve it.Specifically, given a multi-vector search workload, we develop algorithms to find indexes that minimize latency and meet storage and recall constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the baseline, our latency achieves 2.1X to 8.3X speedup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on real-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements.However, construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation, leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world.This paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built" detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned" architectural planes in BIM.Our method performs robust plane matching and computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time.By incorporating BIM as prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the initial manual alignment by the user. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks.Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs.Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues.These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable.To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data.Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate.Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions).This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level.Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have garnered widespread attention due to their superior performance.However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details.Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice.For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time.\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Our source code will be available at https://github.com/WU-CVGL/CasualHDRSplat</p>

                  <p>Fitting distances to tree metrics and ultrametrics are two widely used methods in hierarchical clustering, primarily explored within the context of numerical taxonomy.Given a positive distance function $D:\binom{V}{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or ultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference between the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is minimized.In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric fitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs of elements from $V$ (with $|V|=n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in an arbitrary order.We study these problems under various distance norms:   For the $\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time $\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove that no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we show that the algorithm for $\ell_0$ implies an $O(\Delta/\delta)$ approximation for the $\ell_1$ objective, where $\Delta$ is the maximum and $\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>This bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a combinatorial algorithm when $\Delta/\delta=O(n)$.   For the $\ell_\infty$ objective, we provide a complete characterization of the ultrametric fitting problem.We present a single-pass polynomial-time $\tilde{O}(n)$-space 2-approximation algorithm and show that no better than 2-approximation is possible, even with exponential time.We also show that, with an additional pass, it is possible to achieve a polynomial-time exact algorithm for ultrametrics.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we extend the results for all these objectives to tree metrics by using only one additional pass through the stream and without asymptotically increasing the approximation factor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>The development of powerful user representations is a key factor in the success of recommender systems (RecSys).Online platforms employ a range of RecSys techniques to personalize user experience across diverse in-app surfaces.User representations are often learned individually through user's historical interactions within each surface and user representations across different surfaces can be shared post-hoc as auxiliary features or additional retrieval sources.While effective, such schemes cannot directly encode collaborative filtering signals across different surfaces, hindering its capacity to discover complex relationships between user behaviors and preferences across the whole platform.To bridge this gap at Snapchat, we seek to conduct universal user modeling (UUM) across different in-app surfaces, learning general-purpose user representations which encode behaviors across surfaces.Instead of replacing domain-specific representations, UUM representations capture cross-domain trends, enriching existing representations with complementary information.This work discusses our efforts in developing initial UUM versions, practical challenges, technical choices and modeling and research directions with promising offline performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Following successful A/B testing, UUM representations have been launched in production, powering multiple use cases and demonstrating their value. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>UUM embedding has been incorporated into (i) Long-form Video embedding-based retrieval, leading to 2.78% increase in Long-form Video Open Rate, (ii) Long-form Video L2 ranking, with 19.2% increase in Long-form Video View Time sum, (iii) Lens L2 ranking, leading to 1.76% increase in Lens play time, and (iv) Notification L2 ranking, with 0.87% increase in Notification Open Rate.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

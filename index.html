                  <p>5G wireless networks are complex, leveraging layers of scheduling, retransmission, and adaptation mechanisms to maximize their efficiency.But these mechanisms interact to produce significant fluctuations in uplink and downlink capacity and latency.This markedly impacts the performance of real-time applications, such as video-conferencing, which are particularly sensitive to such fluctuations, resulting in lag, stuttering, distorted audio, and low video quality.This paper presents a cross-layer view of 5G networks and their impact on and interaction with video-conferencing applications.We conduct novel, detailed measurements of both Private CBRS and commercial carrier cellular network dynamics, capturing physical- and link-layer events and correlating them with their effects at the network and transport layers, and the video-conferencing application itself.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our two datasets comprise days of low-rate campus-wide Zoom telemetry data, and hours of high-rate, correlated WebRTC-network-5G telemetry data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>Based on these data, we trace performance anomalies back to root causes, identifying 24 previously unknown causal event chains that degrade 5G video conferencing.Armed with this knowledge, we build Domino, a tool that automates this process and is user-extensible to future wireless networks and interactive applications.</p>

                  <p>Current medical retrieval benchmarks primarily emphasize lexical or shallow semantic similarity, overlooking the reasoning-intensive demands that are central to clinical decision-making.In practice, physicians often retrieve authoritative medical evidence to support diagnostic hypotheses.Such evidence typically aligns with an inferred diagnosis rather than the surface form of a patient's symptoms, leading to low lexical or semantic overlap between queries and relevant documents.To address this gap, we introduce R2MED, the first benchmark explicitly designed for reasoning-driven medical retrieval.It comprises 876 queries spanning three tasks: Q&A reference retrieval, clinical evidence retrieval, and clinical case retrieval.These tasks are drawn from five representative medical scenarios and twelve body systems, capturing the complexity and diversity of real-world medical information needs.We evaluate 15 widely-used retrieval systems on R2MED and find that even the best model achieves only 31.4 nDCG@10, demonstrating the benchmark's difficulty.Classical re-ranking and generation-augmented retrieval methods offer only modest improvements.Although large reasoning models improve performance via intermediate inference generation, the best results still peak at 41.4 nDCG@10.These findings underscore a substantial gap between current retrieval techniques and the reasoning demands of real clinical tasks.We release R2MED as a challenging benchmark to foster the development of next-generation medical retrieval systems with enhanced reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at https://github.com/R2MED/R2MED <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially correct solutions.A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained supervision over intermediate reasoning steps.To address this, we propose MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable framework.We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on diverse mathematical reasoning data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which serves as seed data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling.The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain (MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.) benchmarks.Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance.MM-PRM demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems.We release all our codes and data at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-PRM.</p>

                  <p>Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant to enhance user experience.This calls for designing methods that can allow users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate.For example, controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc.Most existing work attempts to integrate users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale.In this work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or via existing techniques in conditional generation.Through a case study in controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a "low" and a "high" token embedding.Our method more reliably exerts response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods that represent the control signal as a discrete signal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our full open-sourced code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure.Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics.Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors.In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities.In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models.By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner.The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project page is https://customsvg.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks.Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results.Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks.However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task.To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas.Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge.We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span></p>

Korea, and Egypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>Rather than imposing predefined mood categories, we implement a bottom-up, participant-driven approach to organically elicit culturally specific music-related mood terms.We then recruit another pool of human participants to collect 988,925 ratings for these culture-specific descriptors.Our analysis confirms the presence of a valence-arousal structure shared across cultures, yet also reveals significant divergences in how certain mood terms, despite being dictionary equivalents, are perceived cross-culturally.State-of-the-art multimodal models benefit substantially from fine-tuning on our cross-culturally balanced dataset, as evidenced by improved alignment with human evaluations - particularly in non-English contexts.More broadly, our findings inform the ongoing debate on the universality versus cultural specificity of emotional descriptors, and our methodology can contribute to other multimodal and cross-lingual research.</p>

                  <p>Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance.Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma.To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition.Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search.Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning.Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE).While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks.This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and source code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CityAVOS-3DF8. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.914</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering.The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment:The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks.Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications.Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability.We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.</p>

                  <p>Few-shot cross-modal retrieval focuses on learning cross-modal representations with limited training samples, enabling the model to handle unseen classes during inference.Unlike traditional cross-modal retrieval tasks, which assume that both training and testing data share the same class distribution, few-shot retrieval involves data with sparse representations across modalities.Existing methods often fail to adequately model the multi-peak distribution of few-shot cross-modal data, resulting in two main biases in the latent semantic space: intra-modal bias, where sparse samples fail to capture intra-class diversity, and inter-modal bias, where misalignments between image and text distributions exacerbate the semantic gap.These biases hinder retrieval accuracy.To address these issues, we propose a novel method, GCRDP, for few-shot cross-modal retrieval.This approach effectively captures the complex multi-peak distribution of data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and incorporates a multi-positive sample contrastive learning mechanism for comprehensive feature modeling.Additionally, we introduce a new strategy for cross-modal semantic alignment, which constrains the relative distances between image and text feature distributions, thereby improving the accuracy of cross-modal representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework, such as $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$. After over a decade of $\sf Adam$'s dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements, offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency, better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training.However, a significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes.To address both, we propose a new LMO-based method called $\sf Gluon$, capturing prior theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical predictive power.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al.

                  <p>Tabular data, a fundamental data format in machine learning, is predominantly utilized in competitions and real-world applications.The performance of tabular models--such as gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks--can vary significantly across datasets due to differences in feature distributions and task characteristics.Achieving top performance on each dataset often requires specialized expert knowledge.To address this variability, practitioners often aggregate the predictions of multiple models.However, conventional aggregation strategies typically rely on static combination rules and lack instance-level adaptability.In this work, we propose an in-context ensemble framework for tabular prediction that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform dynamic, instance-specific integration of external model predictions.Without access to raw tabular features or semantic information, our method constructs a context around each test instance using its nearest neighbors and the predictions from a pool of external models.Within this enriched context, we introduce Chain of Tabular Thoughts (CoT$^2$), a prompting strategy that guides LLMs through multi-step, interpretable reasoning, making still further progress toward expert-level decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our method outperforms well-tuned baselines and standard ensemble techniques across a wide range of tabular datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure.Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics.Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors.In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities.In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models.By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>The project page is https://customsvg.github.io.</p>

                  <p>The field of text-to-image generation has undergone significant advancements with the introduction of diffusion models.Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions.This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing.SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net.This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image.Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing.The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scientific data volume is growing in size, and as a direct result, the need for faster transfers is also increasing.The scientific community has sought to leverage parallel transfer methods using multi-threaded and multi-source download models to reduce download times.In multi-source transfers, a client downloads data from multiple replicated servers in parallel.Tools such as Aria2 and BitTorrent support such multi-source transfers and have shown improved transfer times.   In this work, we introduce Multi-Source Data Transfer Protocol, MDTP, which further improves multi-source transfer performance.MDTP logically divides a file request into smaller chunk requests and distributes the chunk requests across multiple servers.Chunk sizes are adapted based on each server's performance but selected in a way that ensures each round of requests completes around the same time.We formulate this chunk-size allocation problem as a variant of the bin-packing problem, where adaptive chunking efficiently fills the available capacity "bins" corresponding to each server.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation shows that MDTP reduces transfer times by 10-22% compared to Aria2, the fastest alternative. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Comparisons with other protocols, such as static chunking and BitTorrent, demonstrate even greater improvements.Additionally, we show that MDTP distributes load proportionally across all available replicas, not just the fastest ones, which improves throughput.Finally, we show MDTP maintains high throughput even when latency increases or bandwidth to the fastest server decreases.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their policies with reward signals.Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of rewards, which are provided by verifiers.In this paper, we expose and analyze a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct model outputs.Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers.We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.</p>

                  <p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs when exposed to harmful prompts.Existing safety alignment methods reduce harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks.To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the rest of the reasoning process unsupervised.Empirical results across multiple benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while maintaining reasoning performance.Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain.We further introduce a zero-shot variant that requires no fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation.However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before.Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation.Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding.Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent.We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval.Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis.Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

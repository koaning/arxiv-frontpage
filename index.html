                  <p>A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to understand and respond to natural language instructions.Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment.This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible.To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>We further propose the Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA).It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings.This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively.Experiments demonstrate that RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive performance on standard manipulation tasks.Real-world trials further validate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.Our project page is https://irpn-eai.github.io/rationalvla.</p>

                  <p>Image restoration aims to recover degraded images.However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images.Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination.In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training.This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/</p>

                  <p>Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models (LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the external safety guardrail in real-world products.Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency.Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance.In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness.Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average.Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p>

                  <p>To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology.Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability.Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education.Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings.To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment.WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks.By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics.This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices.However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications.This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive.UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps.It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05.Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges.Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks.AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks.AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system for table tennis using event cameras.Unlike standard cameras, which suffer from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short time window after the opponent's impact.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collect a dataset of ping-pong game sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>Our system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to process only events in the viewer's fovea.This biologically inspired approach improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected trajectories.Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms, including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based 30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from an egocentric perspective using event cameras.</p>

                  <p>Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents.We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models.In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model.This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models.We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines.Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be made available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD) on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of countries that are issuing ID cards.Most PAD systems are trained on one, two, or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns.As a result, they do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an unknown new ID card country.In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities.This work intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents.Different test protocols were used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>Our findings indicate that bona fide images are the key to generalisation.</p>

                  <p>Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions.However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images.Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image.Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively.In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids.We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids.This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span>We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.</p>

                  <p>Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive interfaces.Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization.We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions.Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences.This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.892</span></span>To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics.We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks.In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability.Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.</p>

                  <p>Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$).However, the likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta (y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training, inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses.In this paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs, showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video content.To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to the policy model.A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the preference data via self-reflection.This allows the policy model to obtain high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus mitigating the unintended drop.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce a dynamic label smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead.Moreover, LeanPO offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient Video-LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings.Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \textit{``hello''}).Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser.We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design.Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an arbitrary cutoff point.As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff.Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers.Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.</p>

                  <p>We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds to a distribution over this vocabulary.These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved.Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods.Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead.Specifically, \textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only $51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges.To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components.First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency.Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals.Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance.We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00.We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation.Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p>

                  <p>There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around steering these models using reward models.Training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough, e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs.In this work, we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism and reward achieved by these methods.Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$ produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS.We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Whereas state-of-the-art baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>We complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the candidate solution closer to the data manifold.To our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions.Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients.While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned.Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality.Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their training data with external parties.In this paradigm, workers locally update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or model parameters).While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine) participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming model convergence.Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent.Towards this purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation, assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than honest gradients do from each other.However, in heterogeneous settings, honest gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest outliers from Byzantine ones.In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines' gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence of its effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Metric learning has attracted extensive interest for its ability to provide personalized recommendations based on the importance of observed user-item interactions.Current metric learning methods aim to push negative items away from the corresponding users and positive items by an absolute geometrical distance margin.However, items may come from imbalanced categories with different intra-class variations.Thus, the absolute distance margin may not be ideal for estimating the difference between user preferences over imbalanced items.To this end, we propose a new method, named discrete scale-invariant metric learning (DSIML), by adding binary constraints to users and items, which maps users and items into binary codes of a shared Hamming subspace to speed up the online recommendation.Specifically, we firstly propose a scale-invariant margin based on angles at the negative item points in the shared Hamming subspace.Then, we derive a scale-invariant triple hinge loss based on the margin.To capture more preference difference information, we integrate a pairwise ranking loss into the scale-invariant loss in the proposed model.Due to the difficulty of directly optimizing the mixed integer optimization problem formulated with \textit{log-sum-exp} functions, we seek to optimize its variational quadratic upper bound and learn hash codes with an alternating optimization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that our proposed method is superior to competitive metric learning and hashing-based baselines for recommender systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The implementation code is available at https://github.com/AnonyFeb/dsml.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we provide an analytical study of single-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).Our derivations show that FTN is advantageous for ISAC, and reveal new insights that these advantages come from the fact that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the spectral aliasing due to the mismatch between the symbol rate and the bandwidth of the shaping pulse.Specifically, the communication spectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath channels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the spectral efficiency are derived.We show that the gap between these two bounds corresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the presence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the symbol rate grows higher.Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR variation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the maximum.Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in terms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function.We show that FTN signals generally enjoy a more robust ranging performance.More importantly, we prove that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the undesired peaks in the considered ambiguity function along the Doppler dimension, thereby reducing the ambiguities in velocity estimation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All these conclusions are explicitly verified by numerical results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Computing stabilizing and optimal control actions for legged locomotion in real time is difficult due to the nonlinear, hybrid, and high dimensional nature of these robots.The hybrid nature of the system introduces a combination of discrete and continuous variables which causes issues for numerical optimal control.To address these challenges, we propose a layered architecture that separates the choice of discrete variables and a smooth Model Predictive Controller (MPC).The layered formulation allows for online flexibility and optimality without sacrificing real-time performance through a combination of gradient-free and gradient-based methods.The architecture leverages a sampling-based method for determining discrete variables, and a classical smooth MPC formulation using these fixed discrete variables.We demonstrate the results on a quadrupedal robot stepping over gaps and onto terrain with varying heights.In simulation, we demonstrate the controller on a humanoid robot for gap traversal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The layered approach is shown to be more optimal and reliable than common heuristic-based approaches and faster to compute than pure sampling methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image restoration aims to recover degraded images.However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images.Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination.In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity.To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances.Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training.This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/</p>

                  <p>Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features.These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting.In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts.Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps.Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy.Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration.Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning.However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency.In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space.In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning.Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%.In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average.It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions.Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.Project Website:https://bridgevla.github.io/</p>

                  <p>A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized Recurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption and storage utilization.These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed `hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for a given network architecture and application.Unlike conventional hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one.The goal, therefore, is to discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally expensive and lacks early performance guarantees.To address this challenge, we propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of post-training performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating this LS-based distance with standard hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>LSH reduces search time by an order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full training.Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies superior pruned models.Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their dense counterpart.</p>

                  <p>A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain their outputs.While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing directions in activation space.A key question is how to find directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner.Current methods rely on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch.However, SAEs often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model.Here, we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable.Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering, while aligning with human-interpretable concepts.Further analysis reveals that specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features, exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span></p>

We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy).By excluding deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in 53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).   Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based review analytics.This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and ensuring reliable insights.</p>

We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay.RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program.Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size.   We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines.On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time.Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time.We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages.In contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains significantly underexplored.HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability constraints.Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks beyond structural code generation, including testbench development, assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration for on-chip communication.The objective of our paper is to analyze the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures.This paper introduces the first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and AXI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design abstraction and prompt specificity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The generated designs are assessed for syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform simulation and test benches.</p>

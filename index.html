                  <p>To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology.Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability.Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education.Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings.To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment.WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks.By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics.This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices.However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications.This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive.UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps.It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05.Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges.Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks.AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks.AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data such as images and videos.However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws.Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces.FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors.These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws.We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions.We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/sifanexisted/fundiff. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span></p>

                  <p>The explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has revolutionized digital ownership by enabling the creation, exchange, and monetization of unique assets on blockchain networks.However, this surge in popularity has also given rise to a disturbing trend: the emergence of rug pulls - fraudulent schemes where developers exploit trust and smart contract privileges to drain user funds or invalidate asset ownership.Central to many of these scams are hidden backdoors embedded within NFT smart contracts.Unlike unintentional bugs, these backdoors are deliberately coded and often obfuscated to bypass traditional audits and exploit investor confidence.In this paper, we present a large-scale static analysis of 49,940 verified NFT smart contracts using Slither, a static analysis framework, to uncover latent vulnerabilities commonly linked to rug pulls.We introduce a custom risk scoring model that classifies contracts into high, medium, or low risk tiers based on the presence and severity of rug pull indicators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset was derived from verified contracts on the Ethereum mainnet, and we generate multiple visualizations to highlight red flag clusters, issue prevalence, and co-occurrence of critical vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>While we do not perform live exploits, our results reveal how malicious patterns often missed by simple reviews can be surfaced through static analysis at scale.We conclude by offering mitigation strategies for developers, marketplaces, and auditors to enhance smart contract security.By exposing how hidden backdoors manifest in real-world smart contracts, this work contributes a practical foundation for detecting and mitigating NFT rug pulls through scalable automated analysis.</p>

                  <p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object.Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging.To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references.We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image.For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model.Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions.This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.Project page: https://minfenli.github.io/UA-Pose/</p>

                  <p>Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks.While previous studies primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in practical applications.In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on vision-language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate controlled experiments, we first introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person images and textual descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>We quantify factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and evaluating their performance in the other.Our results reveal that facts learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists between recalling information in the source and target modalities.Furthermore, we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case.At the end, we propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge.We hope our study can inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD) on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of countries that are issuing ID cards.Most PAD systems are trained on one, two, or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns.As a result, they do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an unknown new ID card country.In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities.This work intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents.Different test protocols were used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>Our findings indicate that bona fide images are the key to generalisation.</p>

                  <p>Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions.However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images.Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image.Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively.In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids.We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids.This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span>We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning models have made rapid progress on many benchmarks involving math, code, and science.Yet, there are still many open questions about the best training recipes for reasoning since state-of-the-art models often rely on proprietary datasets with little to no public information available.To address this, the goal of the OpenThoughts project is to create open-source datasets for training reasoning models.After initial explorations, our OpenThoughts2-1M dataset led to OpenThinker2-32B, the first model trained on public reasoning data to match DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B on standard reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and LiveCodeBench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then improve our dataset further by systematically investigating each step of our data generation pipeline with 1,000+ controlled experiments, which led to OpenThoughts3. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Scaling the pipeline to 1.2M examples and using QwQ-32B as teacher yields our OpenThinker3-7B model, which achieves state-of-the-art results: 53% on AIME 2025, 51% on LiveCodeBench 06/24-01/25, and 54% on GPQA Diamond.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All of our datasets and models are available on https://openthoughts.ai. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have notably progressed in multi-step and long-chain reasoning.However, extending their reasoning capabilities to encompass deep interactions with search remains a non-trivial challenge, as models often fail to identify optimal reasoning-search interaction trajectories, resulting in suboptimal responses.We propose R-Search, a novel reinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to enable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search interaction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via multi-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and knowledge-intensive tasks.R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when to retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep knowledge interaction between reasoning and search.During RL training, R-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the reasoning-search trajectory.Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search outperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1% (out-of-domain).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingFei1/R-Search. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span></p>

                  <p>Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$).However, the likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta (y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training, inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses.In this paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs, showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video content.To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to the policy model.A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the preference data via self-reflection.This allows the policy model to obtain high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus mitigating the unintended drop.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce a dynamic label smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead.Moreover, LeanPO offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient Video-LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention.If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office.In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection.The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date.   We introduce PEDANTIC (\underline{P}at\underline{e}nt \underline{D}efiniteness Ex\underline{a}mi\underline{n}a\underline{ti}on \underline{C}orpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness.We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason.We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons.PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models.We will publicly release the dataset and code.</p>

                  <p>Shape-changing haptic interfaces (SCHIs) are a promising and emerging field.However, compared to more established stimulus modalities, such as vibration, there is sparse literature on the perception of dynamic shapes.Furthermore, the influence of properties such as grasp types and displacement magnitude/direction has not been formally evaluated.This work attempts to initiate a formal perceptual evaluation of SCHIs via a psychophysical user study involving a 1-DOF translational shape-changing interface that can move its body with 1.25-micrometer resolution.Participants completed a Method of Constant Stimulus study while holding the device with three different grasps.Stimuli direction occurred both toward and away from the thumb, while the standard stimuli varied between small (0.48 mm) and large (6 mm).Our results indicate that translational SCHIs should maximize the translation magnitude rather than the number of fingers in contact.We also demonstrated how to apply our findings to real-world applications via a simple 'paddle game', where we compared conventional linear mapping with non-linear mapping derived from our perceptual experiment outcomes between the device position and its represented value.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results indicate that the non-linear mapping was more effective, with improved error distribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We hope this work inspires further formal perceptual investigation into other SCHI morphologies.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their training data with external parties.In this paradigm, workers locally update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or model parameters).While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine) participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming model convergence.Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent.Towards this purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation, assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than honest gradients do from each other.However, in heterogeneous settings, honest gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest outliers from Byzantine ones.In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines' gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence of its effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages.In contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains significantly underexplored.HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability constraints.Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks beyond structural code generation, including testbench development, assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration for on-chip communication.The objective of our paper is to analyze the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces the first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and AXI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design abstraction and prompt specificity.The generated designs are assessed for syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform simulation and test benches.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning.However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency.In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space.In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning.Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%.In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average.It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions.Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.Project Website:https://bridgevla.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks.To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks.However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level.To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations.In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities.Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs.With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA.We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins.Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community.For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span></p>

                  <p>A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized Recurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption and storage utilization.These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed `hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for a given network architecture and application.Unlike conventional hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one.The goal, therefore, is to discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally expensive and lacks early performance guarantees.To address this challenge, we propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of post-training performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating this LS-based distance with standard hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>LSH reduces search time by an order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full training.Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies superior pruned models.Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their dense counterpart.</p>

                  <p>This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions.Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis.However, these methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the difficulty of optimizing deformation fields.To overcome this problem, we propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary time and locations.In contrast to canonical Gaussian primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes.In addition, we endow each Gaussian primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments results on several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally different challenge than in static images or text.It requires interpreting fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time.In such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a rich and noisy stream of content.To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally extended cross-modal reasoning on videos.The benchmark spans 10 diverse mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and textual modalities.We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality, totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation.To reflect real-world scenarios, questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended explanations and partially worked-out solutions.Each question includes multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model capabilities.Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and modality-rich mathematical problem settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark and evaluation code are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks.In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from long context.We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g., long-context QA).We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as retrieval scores.We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores.On multi-hop reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers.We also evaluate QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as RankGPT.Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process.This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text.As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information.While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge.In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework.We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding.In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension.Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks.The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.</p>

In this paper, we focus on the F3 DSL of Meta (Facebook), which is a DSL embedded in Python (so it is dynamically-typed) to generate data pipeline description code that is statically-typed.We propose gradual metaprogramming to (1) provide a migration path toward statically typed DSLs, (2) immediately provide earlier detection of code generation type errors, and (3) report the source code location responsible for the type error.Gradual metaprogramming accomplishes this by type checking code fragments and incrementally performing runtime checks as they are spliced together.We define MetaGTLC, a metaprogramming calculus in which a gradually-typed metalanguage manipulates a statically-typed object language, and give semantics to it by translation to the cast calculus MetaCC.We prove that successful metaevaluation always generates a well-typed object program and mechanize the proof in Agda.</p>

                  <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior.   We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay.RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program.Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size.   We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines.On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time.Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time.We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages.In contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains significantly underexplored.HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability constraints.Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks beyond structural code generation, including testbench development, assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration for on-chip communication.The objective of our paper is to analyze the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures.This paper introduces the first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and AXI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design abstraction and prompt specificity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The generated designs are assessed for syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform simulation and test benches.</p>

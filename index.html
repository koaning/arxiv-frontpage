                  <p>Black-box scanners have played a significant role in detecting vulnerabilities for web applications.A key focus in current black-box scanning is increasing test coverage (i.e., accessing more web pages).However, since many web applications are user-oriented, some deep pages can only be accessed through complex user interactions, which are difficult to reach by existing black-box scanners.To fill this gap, a key insight is that web pages contain a wealth of semantic information that can aid in understanding potential user intention.Based on this insight, we propose Hoyen, a black-box scanner that uses the Large Language Model to predict user intention and provide guidance for expanding the scanning scope.Hoyen has been rigorously evaluated on 12 popular open-source web applications and compared with 6 representative tools.The results demonstrate that Hoyen performs a comprehensive exploration of web applications, expanding the attack surface while achieving about 2x than the coverage of other scanners on average, with high request accuracy.Furthermore, Hoyen detected over 90% of its requests towards the core functionality of the application, detecting more vulnerabilities than other scanners, including unique vulnerabilities in well-known web applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data/code is available at https://hoyen.tjunsl.com/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

We highlight for developers that code generated by ChatGPT is more likely to contain vulnerabilities compared to their own code.Furthermore, at times ChatGPT reports incorrect information with apparent confidence, which may mislead less experienced developers.Our findings confirm previous studies in demonstrating that ChatGPT is not sufficiently reliable for generating secure code nor identifying all vulnerabilities, highlighting the continuing importance of static scanners and manual review.</p>

                  <p>While accurate and user-friendly Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial for industrial design and manufacturing, existing methods still struggle to achieve this due to their over-simplified representations or architectures incapable of supporting multimodal design requirements.In this paper, we attempt to tackle this problem from both methods and datasets aspects.First, we propose a cascade MAR with topology predictor (CMT), the first multimodal framework for CAD generation based on Boundary Representation (B-Rep).Specifically, the cascade MAR can effectively capture the ``edge-counters-surface'' priors that are essential in B-Reps, while the topology predictor directly estimates topology in B-Reps from the compact tokens in MAR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, to facilitate large-scale training, we develop a large-scale multimodal CAD dataset, mmABC, which includes over 1.3 million B-Rep models with multimodal annotations, including point clouds, text descriptions, and multi-view images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Extensive experiments show the superior of CMT in both conditional and unconditional CAD generation tasks.For example, we improve Coverage and Valid ratio by +10.68% and +10.3%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods on ABC in unconditional generation.CMT also improves +4.01 Chamfer on image conditioned CAD generation on mmABC.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and pretrained network shall be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs).While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs.The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities.To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training.By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN.Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores.Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations.In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp.However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection).In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data.To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available.PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task.Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.</p>

                  <p>Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced "Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to understand human activities in real-world settings.DARai consists of continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10 different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors, biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.   To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks, (ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and (iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.   Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels.To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/software-and-datasets/darai-daily-activity-recordings-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge.Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL).However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system.During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location.Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers.The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments.To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions.It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Topics over Time (ToT) model captures thematic changes in timestamped datasets by explicitly modeling publication dates jointly with word co-occurrence patterns.However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian fashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems.To address this issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the introduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution.This prior acts as a regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from unstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch.The characteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the first time.Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the single-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document.A variation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a solution.In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times per document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps along the inference process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have tested our models on two datasets: a collection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>The results show that WBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA topic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence over time is reduced by $51\%$ and $34\%$, respectively.Our experiments also demonstrate the superior coherence of WBToT over BToT, which highlights the importance of balancing the time and word modalities.Finally, we illustrate the stability of the online optimization algorithm in WBToT, which allows the application of WBToT to problems that are intractable for standard ToT.</p>

                  <p>C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems.However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases.We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation.By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files.The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness.We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques.We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust.The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting.Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models.However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs.As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation.This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions.Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations.Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model.2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts.Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work.Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>Referring Expression Generation (REG) is a core task for evaluating the pragmatic competence of vision-language systems, requiring not only accurate semantic grounding but also adherence to principles of cooperative communication (Grice, 1975).However, current evaluations of vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook the pragmatic dimension, reducing REG to a region-based captioning task and neglecting Gricean maxims.In this work, we revisit REG from a pragmatic perspective, introducing a new dataset (RefOI) of 1.5k images annotated with both written and spoken referring expressions.Through a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, we identify three key failures of pragmatic competence: (1) failure to uniquely identify the referent, (2) inclusion of excessive or irrelevant information, and (3) misalignment with human pragmatic preference, such as the underuse of minimal spatial cues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that standard automatic evaluations fail to capture these pragmatic violations, reinforcing superficial cues rather than genuine referential success. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Our findings call for a renewed focus on pragmatically informed models and evaluation frameworks that align with real human communication.</p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Salient Object Detection (SOD) methods can locate objects that stand out in an image, assign higher values to their pixels in a saliency map, and binarize the map outputting a predicted segmentation mask.A recent tendency is to investigate pre-trained lightweight models rather than deep neural networks in SOD tasks, coping with applications under limited computational resources.In this context, we have investigated lightweight networks using a methodology named Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), which assumes that the encoder's kernels can be estimated from marker pixels on discriminative regions of a few representative images.This work proposes flyweight networks, hundreds of times lighter than lightweight models, for SOD by combining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, whose weights are estimated for each input image by a given heuristic function.Such FLIM networks are trained from three to four representative images only and without backpropagation, making the models suitable for applications under labeled data constraints as well.We study five adaptive decoders; two of them are introduced here.Differently from the previous ones that rely on one neuron per pixel with shared weights, the heuristic functions of the new adaptive decoders estimate the weights of each neuron per pixel.We compare FLIM models with adaptive decoders for two challenging SOD tasks with three lightweight networks from the state-of-the-art, two FLIM networks with decoders trained by backpropagation, and one FLIM network whose labeled markers define the decoder's weights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed networks over the baselines, revealing the importance of further investigating such methods in new applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills.For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently.DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them.However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them.In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects.This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity.The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it.To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS.Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs.RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.</p>

                  <p>As a fundamental task in machine learning, text classification plays a crucial role in many areas.With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing need for more capable discriminators.Consequently, advances in classification are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs.Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs' intrinsic generative strengths.Generative classification addresses this by prompting the model to directly output labels.However, existing studies still rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one framework.We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference.After an SFT "policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable extra gains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets, this improvement rises to 4.00%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks perform better without such reasoning steps.These insights into the role of explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.</p>

                  <p>Gradient compression is an effective technique for reducing communication costs in federated learning (FL), and error feedback (EF) is usually adopted to remedy the compression errors.However, there remains a lack of systematic study on these techniques in asynchronous FL.In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing the convergence behaviors of FL under different frameworks.We firstly consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and provide an improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and yields a superior convergence rate than prior studies.Then, we consider a variant framework with gradient compression, AsynFLC.We show sufficient conditions for its convergence to the optimum, indicating the interaction between asynchronous delay and compression rate.Our analysis also demonstrates that asynchronous delay amplifies the variance caused by compression, thereby hindering convergence, and such an impact is exacerbated by high data heterogeneity.Furthermore, we study the convergence of AsynFLC-EF, the framework that further integrates EF.We prove that EF can effectively reduce the variance of gradient estimation despite asynchronous delay, which enables AsynFLC-EF to match the convergence rate of AsynFL.We also show that the impact of asynchronous delay on EF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results substantiate our analytical findings very well. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments.Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label.Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings.We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks.Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application.Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments.Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.</p>

                  <p>In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks.Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs.Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues.These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable.To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data.Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate.Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions).This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level.Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fitting distances to tree metrics and ultrametrics are two widely used methods in hierarchical clustering, primarily explored within the context of numerical taxonomy.Given a positive distance function $D:\binom{V}{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or ultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference between the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is minimized.In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric fitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs of elements from $V$ (with $|V|=n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in an arbitrary order.We study these problems under various distance norms:   For the $\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time $\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove that no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we show that the algorithm for $\ell_0$ implies an $O(\Delta/\delta)$ approximation for the $\ell_1$ objective, where $\Delta$ is the maximum and $\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>This bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a combinatorial algorithm when $\Delta/\delta=O(n)$.

                  <p>We consider the Minimum Multi-Commodity Flow Subgraph (MMCFS) problem: given a directed graph $G$ with edge capacities $\mathit{cap}$ and a retention ratio $\alpha\in(0,1)$, find an edge-wise minimum subgraph $G' \subseteq G$ such that for all traffic matrices $T$ routable in $G$ using a multi-commodity flow, $\alpha\cdot T$ is routable in $G'$. This natural yet novel problem is motivated by recent research that investigates how the power consumption in backbone computer networks can be reduced by turning off connections during times of low demand without compromising the quality of service.Since the actual traffic demands are generally not known beforehand, our approach must be traffic-oblivious, i.e., work for all possible sets of simultaneously routable traffic demands in the original network.   In this paper we present the problem, relate it to other known problems in literature, and show several structural results, including a reformulation, maximum possible deviations from the optimum, and NP-hardness (as well as a certain inapproximability) already on very restricted instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The most significant contribution is a tight $\max(\frac{1}{\alpha}, 2)$-approximation based on an algorithmically surprisingly simple LP-rounding scheme. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term devices.However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit increases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of parameters to optimize grows linearly.This results in more iterations required by the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden as more circuit executions are needed.To mitigate this issue, we introduce QAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space.By extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem instances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on larger instances.Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem demonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this comes at the cost of a slight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number of layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by parameter count. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising solution quality.</p>

                  <p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities.However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes.Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space.To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities.To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average.Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning.To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types.Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally.Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets.Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA</p>

Given a graph class $\mathcal{H}$, we consider a general family of graph modification problems, called $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$, where the input is a graph $G$ and the question is whether it is possible to replace some induced subgraph $H_1$ of $G$ on at most $k$ vertices by a graph $H_2$ in $\mathcal{L}(H_1)$ so that the resulting graph belongs to $\mathcal{H}$. $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$ can simulate many graph modification problems including vertex deletion, edge deletion/addition/edition/contraction, vertex identification, subgraph complementation, independent set deletion, (induced) matching deletion/contraction, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present two algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>The first one solves $\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\mathcal{H}$ in time $2^{{\rm poly}(k)}\cdot |V(G)|^2$ for every minor-closed graph class $\mathcal{H}$, where {\rm poly} is a polynomial whose degree depends on $\mathcal{H}$, under a mild technical condition on $\mathcal{L}$. This generalizes the results of Morelle, Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020, ICALP 2023] for the particular case of Vertex Deletion to $\mathcal{H}$ within the same running time.Our second algorithm is an improvement of the first one when $\mathcal{H}$ is the class of graphs embeddable in a surface of Euler genus at most $g$ and runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^{9})}\cdot |V(G)|^2$, where the $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$ notation depends on $g$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parameterized algorithms with a reasonable parametric dependence for such a general family of graph modification problems to minor-closed classes.</p>

                  <p>Optimization plays a vital role in scientific research and practical applications, but formulating a concrete optimization problem described in natural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to solve the problem requires substantial domain expertise.We introduce \textbf{OptimAI}, a framework for solving \underline{Optim}ization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered \underline{AI} agents, achieving superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.Our framework is built upon four key roles: (1) a \emph{formulator} that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a \emph{planner} that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a \emph{coder} and a \emph{code critic} capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions.Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively.Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain.Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, allowing us to conveniently explore the synergistic effect of combining diverse models within a unified system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach attains 88.1\% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 71.2\% on the Optibench (non-linear w/o table) subset, reducing error rates by 58\% and 50\% respectively over prior best results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

The results show significant effects of animation level on the participants' speech and head movement behaviour as recorded by physical sensors, as well as on the subjective sense of presence and the success of the conversation.The largest effects were found for the range of head orientation during speech and the perceived realism of avatars.Participants reported that they were spoken to in a more helpful way when the avatars showed head movements transmitted from the interlocutors than when the avatars' heads were static.   We therefore conclude that the representation of interlocutors must include sufficiently realistic head movements in order to elicit natural communication behaviour.</p>

                  <p>Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field.As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion.Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems.Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field.We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired.We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives.Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time.Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively.In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data.We show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on our conservative estimates.Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality.The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform.We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>
